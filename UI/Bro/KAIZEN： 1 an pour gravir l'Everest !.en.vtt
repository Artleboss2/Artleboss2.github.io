1
00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:30.685 size:60%
I’m scared.

2
00:01:31.618 --> 00:01:32.718 size:60%
We have to stay lucid.

3
00:01:33.418 --> 00:01:34.485 size:60%
We’re going to kill ourselves.

4
00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:35.852 size:60%
Move fast, move fast!

5
00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:37.752 size:60%
Hurry up!

6
00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:38.919 size:60%
Go, go, go!

7
00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:57.985 size:60%
Everest...

8
00:02:00.885 --> 00:02:02.385 size:60%
The highest
mountain in the world.

9
00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.385 size:60%
It’s located in the Himalayas,
between Nepal and China.

10
00:02:09.585 --> 00:02:12.952 size:60%
It’s a legendary peak that has
fascinated mountaineers for ages.

11
00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:17.919 size:60%
And venturing to such extreme

12
00:02:19.685 --> 00:02:20.985 size:60%
altitudes means taking big risks.

13
00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:26.919 size:60%
There are huge crevasses...

14
00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:29.919 size:60%
and a freezing cold...

15
00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:31.985 size:60%
that can claim your limbs.

16
00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:34.718 size:60%
There are avalanches...

17
00:02:37.485 --> 00:02:38.485 size:60%
and of course,

18
00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:39.585 size:60%
there is the altitude.

19
00:02:39.652 --> 00:02:40.652 size:60%
The higher you go...

20
00:02:40.718 --> 00:02:41.852 size:60%
the more your body wastes away.

21
00:02:42.485 --> 00:02:43.718 size:60%
Beyond 7500 meters...

22
00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.518 size:60%
is what we call the “Death Zone.”

23
00:02:45.652 --> 00:02:47.351 size:60%
And if
your body can’t handle it...

24
00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:49.485 size:60%
you risk pulmonary edema...

25
00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.385 size:60%
and swelling of the brain...

26
00:02:51.985 --> 00:02:53.385 size:60%
and you could lose your sight.

27
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:57.451 size:60%
In the Death Zone,
it’s you and yourself.

28
00:02:57.885 --> 00:02:58.785 size:60%
There is no rescue...

29
00:02:59.351 --> 00:02:59.952 size:60%
no helicopter...

30
00:03:00.618 --> 00:03:02.685 size:60%
and it’s almost impossible
to bring the bodies down.

31
00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:06.418 size:60%
And despite that...

32
00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:07.919 size:60%
more than a century ago...

33
00:03:08.485 --> 00:03:10.752 size:60%
expeditions set out to reach the
summit of Everest,

34
00:03:10.785 --> 00:03:11.885 size:60%
but to no avail.

35
00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.385 size:60%
In 1953...

36
00:03:16.718 --> 00:03:18.585 size:60%
Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary

37
00:03:18.752 --> 00:03:20.451 size:60%
reach the
summit for the first time.

38
00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:24.685 size:60%
I’ve always been impressed
by those who push their limits.

39
00:03:24.985 --> 00:03:26.485 size:60%
I think it comes from the mangas

40
00:03:26.552 --> 00:03:27.618 size:60%
I started reading as a child.

41
00:03:28.418 --> 00:03:29.885 size:60%
They’re always
stories with a hero...

42
00:03:29.985 --> 00:03:30.885 size:60%
who has...

43
00:03:31.385 --> 00:03:32.351 size:60%
impossible dreams!

44
00:03:32.585 --> 00:03:34.418 size:60%
And somehow,
he manages to achieve them.

45
00:03:36.385 --> 00:03:36.919 size:60%
But at the time...

46
00:03:37.552 --> 00:03:39.685 size:60%
the only way for me
to live out great adventures...

47
00:03:40.418 --> 00:03:41.585 size:60%
was through video games.

48
00:03:44.985 --> 00:03:46.852 size:60%
Let’s go on an adventure!

49
00:03:49.885 --> 00:03:50.885 size:60%
Actually, Minecraft...

50
00:03:50.985 --> 00:03:52.852 size:60%
is a game
where there’s no real objective.

51
00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.485 size:60%
You meet up with your friends and
create the adventures you want.

52
00:03:55.585 --> 00:03:56.952 size:60%
All right, we did it, guys!

53
00:03:57.351 --> 00:03:57.852 size:60%
Soon afterwards,

54
00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.985 size:60%
I wanted to share them,
so I created my YouTube channel.

55
00:04:00.485 --> 00:04:03.318 size:60%
Here we are for my
first video on YouTube,

56
00:04:03.385 --> 00:04:06.585 size:60%
my name is Inoxtag.
That’s it, I’ve said enough!

57
00:04:06.752 --> 00:04:08.718 size:60%
I did it.
It was my dream to be a YouTuber.

58
00:04:08.785 --> 00:04:11.919 size:60%
Thanks to everyone who has been
there so far, on the channel!

59
00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:13.552 size:60%
There are 100,000 of us.

60
00:04:13.585 --> 00:04:15.585 size:60%
So, I thought,
if I do in video games...

61
00:04:15.752 --> 00:04:16.785 size:60%
why not do it for real?

62
00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:19.385 size:60%
I really challenged myself.

63
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:20.819 size:60%
Today,
we’re going to learn survival.

64
00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:21.752 size:60%
I created concepts.

65
00:04:22.318 --> 00:04:23.451 size:60%
A deadly
epidemic has broken out.

66
00:04:23.552 --> 00:04:25.952 size:60%
For example, 48 hours to
survive a zombie invasion.

67
00:04:27.451 --> 00:04:29.418 size:60%
We all played
a werewolf game with cards,

68
00:04:29.451 --> 00:04:30.919 size:60%
so I thought,
why not do it in real life?

69
00:04:30.985 --> 00:04:33.418 size:60%
This village
is going to be infiltrated.

70
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:36.685 size:60%
We’re going to spend
7 days alone on a desert island.

71
00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:40.752 size:60%
And more and more of you
were following the adventures.

72
00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:46.985 size:60%
YouTube allowed me
to realize my dreams.

73
00:04:50.485 --> 00:04:51.585 size:60%
And a year ago...

74
00:04:51.752 --> 00:04:54.585 size:60%
I decided to embark on a
rather special adventure.

75
00:04:55.418 --> 00:04:57.385 size:60%
He made a big
announcement on his channel...

76
00:04:57.418 --> 00:04:58.985 size:60%
He announced that he
wants to climb Everest.

77
00:04:59.418 --> 00:05:00.985 size:60%
It’s the highest
peak in the world...

78
00:05:01.351 --> 00:05:03.552 size:60%
He comes off
as slightly crazy in his videos.

79
00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:04.752 size:60%
After the announcement,

80
00:05:04.785 --> 00:05:06.885 size:60%
I go online and see that
everyone is talking about it.

81
00:05:08.652 --> 00:05:09.919 size:60%
I got many messages of support!

82
00:05:10.718 --> 00:05:11.985 size:60%
But I was insulted as well.

83
00:05:14.885 --> 00:05:17.618 size:60%
Well, it disrupts the environment
of a mountain that I adore.

84
00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:18.752 size:60%
But what’s left then?

85
00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.785 size:60%
Is it just so
you can say you went up there?

86
00:05:20.852 --> 00:05:21.585 size:60%
But no!

87
00:05:21.618 --> 00:05:24.385 size:60%
You violated Everest! I mean,
I mean, you didn’t see anything!

88
00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:35.552 size:60%
And I understand these people.

89
00:05:36.752 --> 00:05:37.819 size:60%
I’m not from that background...

90
00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:41.485 size:60%
But then I think, why not try?

91
00:05:42.585 --> 00:05:44.385 size:60%
If I’m not ready,
I can turn back.

92
00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:46.885 size:60%
At worst I fail...

93
00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:48.919 size:60%
but at least I learned something.

94
00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:53.518 size:60%
Though,
one thing is for certain...

95
00:05:54.351 --> 00:05:55.318 size:60%
I will have to change.

96
00:05:56.385 --> 00:05:58.618 size:60%
Because at that moment,
my daily life is catastrophic.

97
00:06:03.418 --> 00:06:04.351 size:60%
Welcome to my home.

98
00:06:05.485 --> 00:06:07.385 size:60%
Or I guess, the bathroom!

99
00:06:08.585 --> 00:06:10.652 size:60%
Honestly, it’s embarrassing.
I’m ashamed right now.

100
00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.618 size:60%
I had to move,
and it took longer than expected.

101
00:06:13.752 --> 00:06:15.451 size:60%
I came over here,
to my parents’ house.

102
00:06:15.585 --> 00:06:17.585 size:60%
I said: “It’s fine,
put me in the bathroom.”

103
00:06:17.985 --> 00:06:20.385 size:60%
“It won’t be for long anyway,
I’m moving out soon.”

104
00:06:20.718 --> 00:06:22.752 size:60%
Fast forward, and I’ve
been in here for a year, bro!

105
00:06:23.752 --> 00:06:25.585 size:60%
Living in
a bathroom is pretty crazy.

106
00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:28.952 size:60%
There are flags outside as well.
Let’s close this.

107
00:06:29.618 --> 00:06:30.618 size:60%
Look, I’ll show you how it goes.

108
00:06:30.718 --> 00:06:32.485 size:60%
I finish my live at 2 in the
morning...

109
00:06:32.585 --> 00:06:33.585 size:60%
and I’m exhausted.

110
00:06:33.718 --> 00:06:34.919 size:60%
I open the door, like that.

111
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:37.418 size:60%
I take off my socks,
I take off my clothes...

112
00:06:37.485 --> 00:06:38.885 size:60%
I brush my teeth,
then I go here...

113
00:06:39.585 --> 00:06:40.518 size:60%
and “ciao.”

114
00:06:40.985 --> 00:06:41.718 size:60%
I sleep...

115
00:06:42.618 --> 00:06:43.552 size:60%
then I wake up...

116
00:06:44.585 --> 00:06:45.652 size:60%
The wardrobe is empty...

117
00:06:45.752 --> 00:06:46.852 size:60%
so I go in the bathtub...

118
00:06:46.985 --> 00:06:47.985 size:60%
I put on some shorts...

119
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:51.351 size:60%
I go walk the dog,
I shower upstairs, and I leave.

120
00:06:51.852 --> 00:06:52.985 size:60%
And that’s it!

121
00:06:53.718 --> 00:06:54.919 size:60%
Bro, I don’t really live here!

122
00:06:55.585 --> 00:06:56.618 size:60%
I just come...

123
00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:59.318 size:60%
drop off my stuff,
grab some new things,

124
00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:00.618 size:60%
and take off the next day!

125
00:07:01.418 --> 00:07:01.919 size:60%
Come on, let’s go!

126
00:07:06.852 --> 00:07:08.718 size:60%
Well,
if I had to own up to one thing,

127
00:07:08.752 --> 00:07:10.585 size:60%
my lifestyle is catastrophic.

128
00:07:11.585 --> 00:07:11.635 size:60%
I sleep badly...

129
00:07:12.652 --> 00:07:13.618 size:60%
I’m jetlagged...

130
00:07:14.485 --> 00:07:15.618 size:60%
I eat badly,

131
00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:16.718 size:60%
I don’t pay attention...

132
00:07:17.752 --> 00:07:19.518 size:60%
and physically? Forget about it.

133
00:07:24.552 --> 00:07:27.418 size:60%
When he announced the project...
he wasn’t physically fit.

134
00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:29.919 size:60%
Okay, what’s our pace?

135
00:07:30.785 --> 00:07:33.685 size:60%
Uh, really slow.
Man, my cardio is shit!

136
00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:35.885 size:60%
He never played
sports that involved cardio.

137
00:07:35.985 --> 00:07:37.485 size:60%
So, it’s a quality that he...

138
00:07:37.718 --> 00:07:38.585 size:60%
he never developed.

139
00:07:39.451 --> 00:07:40.451 size:60%
Do you... He’s walking!

140
00:07:40.518 --> 00:07:41.752 size:60%
This is what I call jogging!

141
00:07:42.718 --> 00:07:44.585 size:60%
I thought I looked impressive,
but I guess not!

142
00:07:44.718 --> 00:07:47.485 size:60%
-I’m not doing anything!
-Come on Inox, don’t give up!

143
00:07:47.718 --> 00:07:48.451 size:60%
All right.

144
00:07:48.618 --> 00:07:51.552 size:60%
-What’s your BPM now?
-143!

145
00:07:55.318 --> 00:07:56.685 size:60%
The amount of
training required...

146
00:07:56.752 --> 00:07:59.919 size:60%
to reach a goal like that in one
year is completely overwhelming.

147
00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:01.485 size:60%
Some people will take...

148
00:08:01.552 --> 00:08:02.919 size:60%
5 years to reach
that kind of goal.

149
00:08:02.985 --> 00:08:04.652 size:60%
So, I was definitely uneasy.

150
00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:10.552 size:60%
That’s why I had to
concoct a year-long

151
00:08:10.585 --> 00:08:11.919 size:60%
intensive program for him.

152
00:08:12.752 --> 00:08:15.451 size:60%
It would allow him to reach his
goal, if he could stick to it.

153
00:08:31.585 --> 00:08:32.485 size:60%
I don’t feel so good.

154
00:08:32.585 --> 00:08:32.635 size:60%
I thought my heart
was going to stop.

155
00:08:34.418 --> 00:08:35.518 size:60%
I was already dead at the end,

156
00:08:35.885 --> 00:08:37.485 size:60%
and when you said,
“give it your all?”

157
00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:39.852 size:60%
Man... It was horrible.

158
00:08:45.418 --> 00:08:45.952 size:60%
That’s the shitty part.

159
00:08:47.418 --> 00:08:48.585 size:60%
That’s... the real shitty part.

160
00:08:48.685 --> 00:08:50.752 size:60%
All the red is filming.
The red is for filming.

161
00:08:50.952 --> 00:08:51.885 size:60%
That schedule’s crazy.

162
00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:52.952 size:60%
With all those videos...

163
00:08:52.985 --> 00:08:54.852 size:60%
people, people are going to say,

164
00:08:54.885 --> 00:08:56.685 size:60%
“Either he’s changing his life,
or he’s training for Everest,

165
00:08:56.752 --> 00:08:57.752 size:60%
or he’s making videos.

166
00:08:57.819 --> 00:08:59.385 size:60%
I don’t get it, because he’s
keeping the same pace as before.”

167
00:08:59.418 --> 00:09:01.552 size:60%
You said you would be willing
to pause YouTube for Everest.

168
00:09:02.351 --> 00:09:03.752 size:60%
Well, we’ve
made it to that crossroad...

169
00:09:03.785 --> 00:09:04.919 size:60%
where we’re going to have to

170
00:09:04.952 --> 00:09:06.752 size:60%
cut video production in half,
all right.

171
00:09:06.852 --> 00:09:09.385 size:60%
Remove one out of every two limit

172
00:09:09.418 --> 00:09:10.618 size:60%
it to two videos a month instead.

173
00:09:10.819 --> 00:09:11.885 size:60%
So, we go from...

174
00:09:12.852 --> 00:09:13.819 size:60%
four videos per month...

175
00:09:14.385 --> 00:09:15.451 size:60%
to two videos per month.

176
00:09:17.585 --> 00:09:20.351 size:60%
The training had to be arranged
around his life as a YouTuber.

177
00:09:21.618 --> 00:09:23.585 size:60%
A good, fairly solid workout...

178
00:09:23.652 --> 00:09:25.418 size:60%
One which wouldn’t
cause him to burnout.

179
00:09:26.618 --> 00:09:28.852 size:60%
Idriss was essential for
my physical preparation...

180
00:09:29.351 --> 00:09:31.752 size:60%
but someone was missing
for the mountaineering aspect.

181
00:09:31.819 --> 00:09:32.852 size:60%
But I didn’t know anyone,

182
00:09:32.985 --> 00:09:35.418 size:60%
so I called Nico Mathieu,
my adventuring buddy.

183
00:09:36.552 --> 00:09:37.919 size:60%
And he told
me about a guy called Mathis.

184
00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:40.985 size:60%
Mathis is a mountain guide.

185
00:09:41.552 --> 00:09:44.385 size:60%
He’s also a photographer
and a director, and he’s only 29.

186
00:09:44.618 --> 00:09:46.451 size:60%
He’s the new generation of
mountaineering.

187
00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:47.585 size:60%
He’s done so much.

188
00:09:49.485 --> 00:09:52.351 size:60%
When I heard about the
project for the first time, uh...

189
00:09:52.718 --> 00:09:53.652 size:60%
I said to myself...

190
00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:55.885 size:60%
“Wow, the guy’s a YouTuber
and he’s going to go to Everest!”

191
00:09:56.451 --> 00:09:57.985 size:60%
I admit that at the time,
I definitely was...

192
00:09:58.351 --> 00:09:59.752 size:60%
apprehensive about the project.

193
00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:00.952 size:60%
I thought, “This guy, uh...

194
00:10:01.618 --> 00:10:02.752 size:60%
He wants to take
on a challenge...

195
00:10:02.819 --> 00:10:03.885 size:60%
He wants to be well known...

196
00:10:03.919 --> 00:10:06.485 size:60%
Uh... Is he doing it
for the right reasons?

197
00:10:06.552 --> 00:10:07.518 size:60%
The right motivations?”

198
00:10:07.785 --> 00:10:09.418 size:60%
But I still wanted to meet him.

199
00:10:09.585 --> 00:10:10.985 size:60%
So, I told him
to come to my house in Chamonix

200
00:10:11.351 --> 00:10:13.752 size:60%
for three weeks, so he could
learn about mountaineering...

201
00:10:13.985 --> 00:10:15.418 size:60%
Then we’d see what we could do.

202
00:10:34.585 --> 00:10:36.552 size:60%
Grab it with your hand,
then slide on down...

203
00:10:36.885 --> 00:10:37.585 size:60%
and go back.

204
00:10:37.752 --> 00:10:39.385 size:60%
-Grab it with my hand...
-Yeah. Exactly!

205
00:10:39.418 --> 00:10:42.985 size:60%
Then I get my hand and slide
it down... and then, I go back.

206
00:10:43.485 --> 00:10:43.852 size:60%
Exactly.

207
00:10:43.985 --> 00:10:45.785 size:60%
But look, you really
have to trust the person!

208
00:10:45.852 --> 00:10:47.618 size:60%
I mean,
why should I blindly trust you?

209
00:10:47.985 --> 00:10:49.518 size:60%
If you fall, I’ll end up dead!

210
00:10:49.618 --> 00:10:51.385 size:60%
I’m going to have to
trust you!

211
00:10:52.919 --> 00:10:54.585 size:60%
I know I won’t fall, you know?

212
00:10:55.318 --> 00:10:56.852 size:60%
Let’s see if he knows
how to correctly tie a knot.

213
00:10:57.318 --> 00:10:59.752 size:60%
I’m going to tie a figure eight
knot. You’re going to be shocked.

214
00:11:00.685 --> 00:11:01.752 size:60%
So far, not great.

215
00:11:04.385 --> 00:11:05.518 size:60%
Don’t you have
that in Minecraft?

216
00:11:07.552 --> 00:11:08.585 size:60%
Aw damn, I messed up.

217
00:11:08.819 --> 00:11:10.485 size:60%
Stupid figure eight knot!

218
00:11:10.618 --> 00:11:11.785 size:60%
Can I go up with this?

219
00:11:11.919 --> 00:11:13.585 size:60%
Yeah, you can. After...

220
00:11:13.618 --> 00:11:15.351 size:60%
Good luck,
we’re not tied together!

221
00:11:15.418 --> 00:11:16.552 size:60%
I’ll give you a tip.

222
00:11:16.585 --> 00:11:18.718 size:60%
Make a simple figure 8 knot,
then make the double one.

223
00:11:18.785 --> 00:11:19.385 size:60%
Okay.

224
00:11:19.485 --> 00:11:19.919 size:60%
Now I got it.

225
00:11:19.952 --> 00:11:21.752 size:60%
So, just follow the rope.

226
00:11:24.752 --> 00:11:25.952 size:60%
My first real knot!

227
00:11:27.718 --> 00:11:28.685 size:60%
Yes. Keep going...

228
00:11:28.885 --> 00:11:30.585 size:60%
You have
to keep your heels lower,

229
00:11:30.652 --> 00:11:31.952 size:60%
you’re still raising
up them too much.

230
00:11:32.385 --> 00:11:33.552 size:60%
There you go, that’s better.

231
00:11:40.385 --> 00:11:40.985 size:60%
That was scary!

232
00:11:41.385 --> 00:11:42.852 size:60%
Remember to lower your heels,
Inox!

233
00:11:43.418 --> 00:11:44.552 size:60%
Should I give him a little rope?

234
00:11:45.685 --> 00:11:46.752 size:60%
Yeah, he’s acting smug.

235
00:11:46.919 --> 00:11:49.885 size:60%
Easy! Whoa! You bastard!

236
00:11:50.985 --> 00:11:52.418 size:60%
I almost had a heart attack!

237
00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:54.485 size:60%
-Let’s do this.
-I’m ready!

238
00:11:54.552 --> 00:11:55.718 size:60%
It’s my first time
in the mountains,

239
00:11:55.752 --> 00:11:57.451 size:60%
and to be honest,
they made fun of me.

240
00:11:58.418 --> 00:11:59.685 size:60%
Everything went
well with Mathis...

241
00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:02.685 size:60%
In fact, he brought along Léo
Slemett, the world ski champ.

242
00:12:02.752 --> 00:12:04.718 size:60%
No pressure, it was just
my first training session...

243
00:12:05.752 --> 00:12:07.485 size:60%
It looks
sorta scary from up here.

244
00:12:07.585 --> 00:12:08.985 size:60%
Honestly, it looks unclimbable.

245
00:12:09.585 --> 00:12:11.685 size:60%
Uh, Inox?
Keep an eye on the descender.

246
00:12:11.952 --> 00:12:12.685 size:60%
Okay.

247
00:12:26.652 --> 00:12:28.752 size:60%
-Shit! What the...
-Be careful! Watch out!

248
00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:30.819 size:60%
The descender just fell!

249
00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:33.385 size:60%
-You guys are crazy!
-My bad!

250
00:12:33.852 --> 00:12:35.585 size:60%
Dammit,
I can’t believe I dropped it.

251
00:12:36.718 --> 00:12:37.618 size:60%
I’m an idiot.

252
00:12:38.985 --> 00:12:40.351 size:60%
I can’t go back down.

253
00:12:40.852 --> 00:12:43.685 size:60%
Hey, Mathis? What do I do
if the descender falls down?

254
00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:45.685 size:60%
Don’t worry,
we’ll find a solution.

255
00:12:50.752 --> 00:12:53.819 size:60%
Wow, that drop is crazy.
That was really stressful.

256
00:12:54.485 --> 00:12:55.451 size:60%
Well done, bro.

257
00:12:55.885 --> 00:12:57.819 size:60%
-Yeah, but I’m an idiot!
-Why?

258
00:12:57.919 --> 00:13:00.585 size:60%
Dropping the descender
like that was a stupid mistake.

259
00:13:00.752 --> 00:13:01.919 size:60%
You have to be careful.
That’s why there’s...

260
00:13:01.952 --> 00:13:04.652 size:60%
Dammit... Because of me,
we both have to pay.

261
00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:06.919 size:60%
There are techniques you
can use...

262
00:13:07.451 --> 00:13:08.351 size:60%
but they’re annoying.

263
00:13:09.351 --> 00:13:10.418 size:60%
It’s a pain without one.

264
00:13:10.451 --> 00:13:12.418 size:60%
Dammit, I’m so stupid.
I’m sorry.

265
00:13:12.485 --> 00:13:12.985 size:60%
No biggie. It could be worse.

266
00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:14.652 size:60%
It’s a mistake I
shouldn’t have made.

267
00:13:14.885 --> 00:13:17.552 size:60%
-I’ll never do that again.
-Be more careful in future.

268
00:13:18.652 --> 00:13:19.785 size:60%
What I like about Mathis,

269
00:13:19.852 --> 00:13:21.552 size:60%
is that he introduced
me to mountain sports.

270
00:13:21.985 --> 00:13:23.418 size:60%
Welcome to the Mountains.

271
00:13:24.385 --> 00:13:25.985 size:60%
Look at that!
Now we’re really getting started!

272
00:13:27.952 --> 00:13:29.385 size:60%
It’s incredible!

273
00:13:29.952 --> 00:13:32.718 size:60%
But it’s kinda scary in
real life. The drop is...

274
00:13:32.785 --> 00:13:34.985 size:60%
-It’s thousands of meters. So...
-So, if we fall, we’re dead.

275
00:13:35.385 --> 00:13:36.952 size:60%
If we fall, we’re dead.
We don’t stand a chance.

276
00:13:37.351 --> 00:13:37.652 size:60%
Okay.

277
00:13:37.852 --> 00:13:40.585 size:60%
Well, isn’t that reassuring
for a first expedition!

278
00:13:44.685 --> 00:13:46.819 size:60%
If we fall on either side,
it’s the end.

279
00:13:46.885 --> 00:13:48.518 size:60%
-We’d be dead, right?
-Yeah, we’d be dead.

280
00:13:57.485 --> 00:13:58.819 size:60%
Uh, we’ll be close to that
big serac...

281
00:13:59.552 --> 00:14:00.518 size:60%
it’s just below.

282
00:14:02.852 --> 00:14:04.919 size:60%
Seracs
are actually big blocks of ice

283
00:14:04.985 --> 00:14:06.418 size:60%
that are
attached to the mountain,

284
00:14:06.451 --> 00:14:07.785 size:60%
and they
can collapse at any moment.

285
00:14:12.552 --> 00:14:14.385 size:60%
But there are times when
you have to go under a serac

286
00:14:14.418 --> 00:14:15.485 size:60%
and whether you’re...

287
00:14:15.585 --> 00:14:16.952 size:60%
Kilian Jornet, Nims Dai, or...

288
00:14:16.985 --> 00:14:19.585 size:60%
some guy from Paris who’s doing
it for the very first time...

289
00:14:19.752 --> 00:14:20.852 size:60%
everyone takes the same risk.

290
00:14:21.418 --> 00:14:22.418 size:60%
Damn, that’s crazy, huh?

291
00:14:22.652 --> 00:14:23.919 size:60%
You go...
and if it falls, then good luck!

292
00:14:23.952 --> 00:14:24.785 size:60%
It could fall on you.

293
00:14:30.518 --> 00:14:31.485 size:60%
It happens randomly.

294
00:14:31.585 --> 00:14:34.552 size:60%
We’re here to minimize the risk,
but if you get unlucky, uh...

295
00:14:34.752 --> 00:14:35.685 size:60%
you’ll be crushed.

296
00:14:47.318 --> 00:14:49.852 size:60%
-Whoa, dude!
-Stop it! What the heck?

297
00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:51.385 size:60%
What a pain in the butt!
You’re so annoying!

298
00:14:51.451 --> 00:14:52.585 size:60%
He’s already salty,
and I just got here!

299
00:14:52.618 --> 00:14:54.652 size:60%
I just arrived and he’s salty!
What’s up, man?

300
00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:56.952 size:60%
Jeez! Come on, dude, damn! Bro,
you know that I don’t like that!

301
00:14:56.985 --> 00:14:58.418 size:60%
I mean, come on!

302
00:14:58.518 --> 00:14:59.819 size:60%
Imagine,
he gets back from the mountain:

303
00:14:59.885 --> 00:15:01.418 size:60%
“Dude,
I’m gonna become a mountaineer.”

304
00:15:01.451 --> 00:15:02.652 size:60%
-I’m gonna become a mountaineer!
-I knew it!

305
00:15:04.752 --> 00:15:06.518 size:60%
I felt like they
wanted to transmit...

306
00:15:06.685 --> 00:15:08.385 size:60%
the true art of mountaineering.

307
00:15:08.785 --> 00:15:10.752 size:60%
It’s an art, it’s...
a discipline!

308
00:15:10.985 --> 00:15:13.685 size:60%
And they’re open to
teaching me how to, uh...

309
00:15:14.351 --> 00:15:14.985 size:60%
do things well...

310
00:15:15.451 --> 00:15:17.718 size:60%
and to really
experience mountaineering.

311
00:15:19.618 --> 00:15:21.919 size:60%
I’m really pleasantly surprised,
he’s in good shape.

312
00:15:22.718 --> 00:15:24.585 size:60%
He picks up all the

313
00:15:24.652 --> 00:15:25.752 size:60%
mountaineering
techniques pretty quickly,

314
00:15:25.785 --> 00:15:27.618 size:60%
and he’s really improved his
climbing and

315
00:15:27.685 --> 00:15:28.752 size:60%
crampon techniques...

316
00:15:29.385 --> 00:15:29.885 size:60%
so that’s great.

317
00:15:30.418 --> 00:15:31.985 size:60%
I kicked and moved,
and kicked and moved

318
00:15:32.585 --> 00:15:34.618 size:60%
I saw you, you were
really swinging your ice axe!

319
00:15:37.785 --> 00:15:39.418 size:60%
After spending
some time with him,

320
00:15:39.585 --> 00:15:41.418 size:60%
I agreed to
accompany him on his adventure.

321
00:15:41.819 --> 00:15:42.952 size:60%
Although, we still don’t know...

322
00:15:43.351 --> 00:15:45.418 size:60%
how his body
will react to the high altitude.

323
00:15:46.552 --> 00:15:48.485 size:60%
We haven’t gone
above 4000 meters yet.

324
00:15:49.852 --> 00:15:51.518 size:60%
When you
announce such a big project...

325
00:15:51.752 --> 00:15:53.919 size:60%
and don’t know if your
body can handle the altitude,

326
00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:55.685 size:60%
you may not even be
able to climb Mont Blanc.

327
00:15:55.752 --> 00:15:56.919 size:60%
And Everest? Forget about it!

328
00:15:57.885 --> 00:15:59.819 size:60%
For the moment,
Inès has no idea...

329
00:15:59.952 --> 00:16:02.318 size:60%
how his body will
react to the altitude.

330
00:16:02.985 --> 00:16:05.785 size:60%
So, it’s imperative that he
does a stress test under hypoxia.

331
00:16:13.685 --> 00:16:14.919 size:60%
So, today is test day.

332
00:16:15.351 --> 00:16:16.518 size:60%
It’s the hypoxia test.

333
00:16:16.618 --> 00:16:17.852 size:60%
It will
allow us to test your body’s

334
00:16:17.919 --> 00:16:19.819 size:60%
resistance to a lack of oxygen.

335
00:16:19.885 --> 00:16:21.985 size:60%
The higher you go, the less
oxygen you’ll have access to.

336
00:16:22.485 --> 00:16:23.451 size:60%
This is one of the...

337
00:16:23.518 --> 00:16:25.518 size:60%
best indicators to know
if you’re up to this or not.

338
00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:26.652 size:60%
And, unfortunately,

339
00:16:26.718 --> 00:16:27.852 size:60%
it’s something that
doesn’t change with training.

340
00:16:27.919 --> 00:16:28.952 size:60%
If you don’t test well...

341
00:16:29.585 --> 00:16:30.885 size:60%
It’s over. So long, adventure.

342
00:16:32.852 --> 00:16:33.485 size:60%
So, then...

343
00:16:33.718 --> 00:16:35.852 size:60%
even if I work hard and
train for a whole year...

344
00:16:35.919 --> 00:16:37.418 size:60%
that’s it,
the parameter can’t be changed.

345
00:16:37.451 --> 00:16:39.351 size:60%
You’d be screwed. It’s over.
You go back home.

346
00:17:03.451 --> 00:17:03.785 size:60%
Begin!

347
00:17:12.885 --> 00:17:14.685 size:60%
So,
we’ve taken you up in altitude...

348
00:17:14.952 --> 00:17:16.919 size:60%
then you came back down,
went back up, etcetera.

349
00:17:17.552 --> 00:17:19.552 size:60%
Now, we’re going to
begin the second phase,

350
00:17:19.585 --> 00:17:20.752 size:60%
and push you to the maximum.

351
00:17:30.585 --> 00:17:32.919 size:60%
Show your true level?
Push through, push through...

352
00:17:36.585 --> 00:17:37.752 size:60%
That’s it, use your rage!

353
00:17:37.919 --> 00:17:38.652 size:60%
Go for it!

354
00:17:38.718 --> 00:17:39.919 size:60%
That’s it, keep going!
Use your rage!

355
00:17:41.385 --> 00:17:42.418 size:60%
You’re good,
you’re good, you’re good!

356
00:17:42.518 --> 00:17:44.552 size:60%
Go! You got this!

357
00:17:45.351 --> 00:17:46.718 size:60%
Don’t stop, don’t stop!
You’re almost there!

358
00:17:54.485 --> 00:17:55.318 size:60%
So, Inès...

359
00:17:55.752 --> 00:17:59.652 size:60%
your heart just accelerated
to 195 beats per minute...

360
00:17:59.852 --> 00:18:01.685 size:60%
and you reached a VO2 max...

361
00:18:01.985 --> 00:18:04.685 size:60%
of, uh, 51.7.

362
00:18:04.819 --> 00:18:05.518 size:60%
Which means...

363
00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:07.518 size:60%
you may be more comfortable
when exerting force...

364
00:18:07.785 --> 00:18:08.985 size:60%
but at very high altitudes,

365
00:18:09.351 --> 00:18:11.318 size:60%
it’s not necessarily
a major advantage.

366
00:18:11.385 --> 00:18:12.752 size:60%
And what would be an advantage
when you’re going to...

367
00:18:12.819 --> 00:18:15.852 size:60%
An advantage would be a good
ventilatory response to hypoxia,

368
00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:16.618 size:60%
in other words...

369
00:18:16.685 --> 00:18:18.952 size:60%
good chemoreceptors,
which is what we tested

370
00:18:19.485 --> 00:18:20.585 size:60%
during the first phase.

371
00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:23.485 size:60%
Here you go...

372
00:18:23.552 --> 00:18:24.819 size:60%
So, as you can see, the results

373
00:18:24.885 --> 00:18:26.852 size:60%
are listed right
here on this piece of paper...

374
00:18:27.885 --> 00:18:29.952 size:60%
which will allow
you to visualize

375
00:18:29.985 --> 00:18:31.652 size:60%
your tolerance to high altitudes.

376
00:18:31.785 --> 00:18:32.351 size:60%
Okay.

377
00:18:33.418 --> 00:18:36.752 size:60%
So, you got a 3 and 5,
and normal is less than 5.5.

378
00:18:36.885 --> 00:18:38.585 size:60%
So, you’re good in either case.

379
00:18:40.318 --> 00:18:43.552 size:60%
However, you should know that
Everest is still dangerous, huh?

380
00:18:43.785 --> 00:18:45.585 size:60%
There’s the altitude,
and there’s the cold...

381
00:18:45.718 --> 00:18:48.718 size:60%
there’s the risk of avalanches,
of falling seracs, uh...

382
00:18:48.985 --> 00:18:51.552 size:60%
Yeah, there are lots of
elements to take into account.

383
00:18:51.585 --> 00:18:52.885 size:60%
the level of danger

384
00:18:52.919 --> 00:18:55.618 size:60%
associated
with this kind of objective.

385
00:18:56.418 --> 00:18:56.852 size:60%
Right.

386
00:19:01.418 --> 00:19:02.718 size:60%
Now that he’s passed the test...

387
00:19:03.785 --> 00:19:05.418 size:60%
we’re going to get
down to business.

388
00:19:09.385 --> 00:19:10.451 size:60%
We’re going to go up there?!

389
00:19:10.518 --> 00:19:11.819 size:60%
Are you trying to kill me?!

390
00:19:13.518 --> 00:19:13.919 size:60%
No...

391
00:19:14.885 --> 00:19:15.752 size:60%
at least, not yet.

392
00:19:17.418 --> 00:19:18.685 size:60%
This rock is scary, bro

393
00:19:18.752 --> 00:19:20.451 size:60%
Why’s that? What scares you?

394
00:19:20.652 --> 00:19:21.718 size:60%
It’s so steep!

395
00:19:22.819 --> 00:19:23.618 size:60%
And it’s huge!

396
00:19:53.585 --> 00:19:54.351 size:60%
Come on!

397
00:20:11.718 --> 00:20:12.752 size:60%
You’re doing good, bro.

398
00:20:20.785 --> 00:20:21.718 size:60%
Come on...

399
00:20:22.385 --> 00:20:23.385 size:60%
mind over matter...

400
00:20:46.585 --> 00:20:47.518 size:60%
Look at that...

401
00:20:47.752 --> 00:20:50.752 size:60%
-It must be, like, 4,000 meters!
-Yeah, it’s an impressive drop.

402
00:20:50.985 --> 00:20:52.919 size:60%
I’ve never been so
scared in my whole life!

403
00:20:53.618 --> 00:20:54.485 size:60%
It’s good for you!

404
00:20:54.552 --> 00:20:56.685 size:60%
You wanted
us to do more stuff, so we are!

405
00:20:56.752 --> 00:20:57.752 size:60%
No, but more of a...

406
00:20:57.785 --> 00:20:59.552 size:60%
beginner level, you know?

407
00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:01.685 size:60%
-Bro... I...
-Have you ever done this one?

408
00:21:01.885 --> 00:21:03.652 size:60%
-No, never.
-Are you serious?

409
00:21:03.718 --> 00:21:04.718 size:60%
First time for us both!

410
00:21:05.385 --> 00:21:07.385 size:60%
-Are you kidding me?
-Oh, yeah! First timers!

411
00:21:07.418 --> 00:21:07.952 size:60%
You’ve never done it?

412
00:21:08.318 --> 00:21:09.785 size:60%
No, never!
What difference does it make?

413
00:21:10.518 --> 00:21:11.885 size:60%
Oh, man, this guy is crazy!

414
00:21:12.885 --> 00:21:14.752 size:60%
He’s never climbed it,
but he brings me!

415
00:21:14.785 --> 00:21:16.685 size:60%
Yo dude,
have you seen how steep it is?

416
00:21:16.752 --> 00:21:18.351 size:60%
Did you
even look at the mountain face?

417
00:21:18.418 --> 00:21:19.418 size:60%
Yeah, I see it...

418
00:21:19.752 --> 00:21:20.618 size:60%
It’s pretty steep.

419
00:21:21.952 --> 00:21:23.819 size:60%
It’s hard now,
but we’ll be glad we did it.

420
00:21:24.952 --> 00:21:25.718 size:60%
Yes.

421
00:21:25.752 --> 00:21:27.351 size:60%
We’ll grab a big burger
down there...

422
00:21:27.485 --> 00:21:28.618 size:60%
when we get down.

423
00:21:28.685 --> 00:21:29.752 size:60%
If we’re still alive.

424
00:21:53.852 --> 00:21:55.885 size:60%
You got this, bro. Come on.

425
00:22:20.752 --> 00:22:21.451 size:60%
We did it.

426
00:22:21.885 --> 00:22:23.618 size:60%
I’m happy with you.
Good work, bro.

427
00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:26.485 size:60%
That’s good, you did well.

428
00:22:26.585 --> 00:22:28.952 size:60%
We did it... Thank you, Mathis.

429
00:22:29.852 --> 00:22:32.985 size:60%
Congratulations.
That took real courage.

430
00:22:34.919 --> 00:22:36.418 size:60%
I’m proud of you, bro.

431
00:22:36.552 --> 00:22:37.919 size:60%
Thanks, bro.
It’s all thanks to you.

432
00:22:38.418 --> 00:22:39.652 size:60%
You truly outdid yourself.

433
00:22:41.351 --> 00:22:42.518 size:60%
Now this part’s really scary.

434
00:22:43.752 --> 00:22:45.985 size:60%
-My leg is shaking by itself.
-Go ahead, be careful.

435
00:22:47.952 --> 00:22:49.718 size:60%
Okay... okay...

436
00:22:50.385 --> 00:22:50.752 size:60%
stay calm...

437
00:22:51.752 --> 00:22:54.385 size:60%
Stay calm, Inès! Stay calm.

438
00:23:05.418 --> 00:23:06.485 size:60%
Holy shit, bro!

439
00:23:07.685 --> 00:23:08.585 size:60%
Oh my God!

440
00:23:27.652 --> 00:23:28.485 size:60%
I’m telling you...

441
00:23:28.919 --> 00:23:30.318 size:60%
that summit was the worst.

442
00:23:32.418 --> 00:23:32.718 size:60%
It was the worst.

443
00:23:32.785 --> 00:23:34.351 size:60%
Well,
it’s only going to get worse.

444
00:23:35.418 --> 00:23:35.919 size:60%
I told you...

445
00:23:36.585 --> 00:23:37.752 size:60%
this summer will be busy.

446
00:23:38.652 --> 00:23:40.385 size:60%
Mont Blanc,
the highest peak in the Alps.

447
00:23:40.451 --> 00:23:40.785 size:60%
Let’s go!

448
00:23:42.552 --> 00:23:44.418 size:60%
Don’t go into the red.
Tell me if I’m too fast.

449
00:23:44.518 --> 00:23:46.385 size:60%
I’m following you.
I’m not slowing down yet.

450
00:23:50.552 --> 00:23:51.718 size:60%
I can’t believe my eyes.

451
00:23:51.785 --> 00:23:53.819 size:60%
It’s
an incredible feeling, brother.

452
00:23:54.585 --> 00:23:55.885 size:60%
Pack your things,
we’re going to Switzerland!

453
00:23:55.919 --> 00:23:58.385 size:60%
Are you telling me that we’re
going to climb another mountain!

454
00:23:58.418 --> 00:23:59.485 size:60%
In Switzerland with the Swiss!

455
00:23:59.518 --> 00:24:00.752 size:60%
-Can you see from here?
-Normally.

456
00:24:01.585 --> 00:24:02.685 size:60%
What a monster!

457
00:24:03.752 --> 00:24:04.685 size:60%
The mountain...

458
00:24:04.752 --> 00:24:05.885 size:60%
is terrifying!

459
00:24:07.585 --> 00:24:09.652 size:60%
I took Aminé
and Idriss to climb Toubkal!

460
00:24:09.752 --> 00:24:10.985 size:60%
-“Toubkal.”
-“Tupac?”

461
00:24:11.785 --> 00:24:13.718 size:60%
It’s the
highest mountain in North Africa.

462
00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:14.985 size:60%
4200 meters!

463
00:24:16.752 --> 00:24:17.685 size:60%
The goal is not to complain.

464
00:24:17.785 --> 00:24:18.785 size:60%
I’m not going to stop.

465
00:24:19.585 --> 00:24:20.752 size:60%
Are you sleeping? Let’s go!

466
00:24:21.351 --> 00:24:22.752 size:60%
Then,
I got a call from Nico Mathieu...

467
00:24:22.785 --> 00:24:24.685 size:60%
who suggested I
cross Corsica on foot.

468
00:24:24.785 --> 00:24:25.919 size:60%
Cross Corsica on the trail.

469
00:24:26.418 --> 00:24:27.819 size:60%
This is the start of the GR20.

470
00:24:27.885 --> 00:24:29.952 size:60%
5 days of walking with Nico,
non-stop!

471
00:24:30.752 --> 00:24:32.518 size:60%
As for Everest, mentally,

472
00:24:32.585 --> 00:24:34.618 size:60%
there’s nothing better
to build a mind of steel.

473
00:24:35.952 --> 00:24:36.919 size:60%
And we continue...

474
00:24:37.752 --> 00:24:38.652 size:60%
We continue...

475
00:24:38.919 --> 00:24:39.952 size:60%
and we don’t stop.

476
00:24:40.418 --> 00:24:41.985 size:60%
He’s running now,
I can’t take it.

477
00:24:42.785 --> 00:24:43.919 size:60%
Chill, it’s all good.

478
00:24:45.685 --> 00:24:46.919 size:60%
We did so much...

479
00:24:47.785 --> 00:24:48.919 size:60%
and my mom even joined us.

480
00:24:48.985 --> 00:24:50.652 size:60%
-Are you getting tired, Mom?
-No...

481
00:24:50.718 --> 00:24:53.418 size:60%
but I would get tired when
you would refuse to go outside!

482
00:24:53.552 --> 00:24:54.618 size:60%
-Because of the computer?
-Yes!

483
00:24:54.718 --> 00:24:55.418 size:60%
When I was 13.

484
00:24:55.485 --> 00:24:56.952 size:60%
He wanted to spend
the day in front of the computer?

485
00:24:57.752 --> 00:24:59.919 size:60%
Go in the bush behind you! Now,
press P. Press the P.

486
00:24:59.952 --> 00:25:00.585 size:60%
You got it.

487
00:25:06.685 --> 00:25:07.752 size:60%
When did
you really get into playing?

488
00:25:07.785 --> 00:25:10.385 size:60%
When my mom got a PC,
I installed Minecraft on it,

489
00:25:10.418 --> 00:25:12.852 size:60%
and I think she
regretted buying that computer.

490
00:25:13.418 --> 00:25:13.718 size:60%
No.

491
00:25:14.451 --> 00:25:15.919 size:60%
No, but I
would have if you hadn’t gotten

492
00:25:15.952 --> 00:25:17.418 size:60%
to where you are now,

493
00:25:17.451 --> 00:25:18.752 size:60%
outside in nature.

494
00:25:20.418 --> 00:25:21.418 size:60%
I have no regrets,

495
00:25:21.451 --> 00:25:22.552 size:60%
because finally...

496
00:25:22.585 --> 00:25:23.952 size:60%
you’ve discovered life.

497
00:25:25.919 --> 00:25:26.852 size:60%
It’s amazing.

498
00:25:29.552 --> 00:25:30.752 size:60%
Amazing!

499
00:25:31.485 --> 00:25:32.552 size:60%
It’s incredible up here!

500
00:25:37.752 --> 00:25:38.485 size:60%
Is this the end?

501
00:25:38.752 --> 00:25:39.752 size:60%
Hey, look at this!

502
00:25:40.351 --> 00:25:41.385 size:60%
The summit!

503
00:25:44.685 --> 00:25:46.919 size:60%
Let’s go!

504
00:25:50.819 --> 00:25:51.785 size:60%
Thank you, Mathis.

505
00:25:52.919 --> 00:25:54.318 size:60%
You made my life beautiful.

506
00:25:54.652 --> 00:25:55.985 size:60%
But seriously,
I’m being serious...

507
00:25:56.518 --> 00:25:57.985 size:60%
I’ve discovered a
real passion for this.

508
00:25:59.451 --> 00:26:01.585 size:60%
In recent years, I haven’t
been that close to my parents,

509
00:26:01.652 --> 00:26:02.451 size:60%
so, I, uh...

510
00:26:02.518 --> 00:26:03.985 size:60%
decided to give my mother a gift.

511
00:26:04.318 --> 00:26:05.451 size:60%
This is our destination.

512
00:26:05.585 --> 00:26:06.585 size:60%
No, no way.

513
00:26:06.752 --> 00:26:08.385 size:60%
You wanted to fly,
so we’re gonna fly.

514
00:26:09.585 --> 00:26:10.819 size:60%
-Shall we go over then?
-Let’s do it!

515
00:26:11.752 --> 00:26:13.418 size:60%
How beautiful, thank you!

516
00:26:48.919 --> 00:26:50.618 size:60%
Mathis, did you wake up one day

517
00:26:50.852 --> 00:26:53.985 size:60%
and say to yourself, “I’m gonna
join that silly little YouTuber”?

518
00:26:55.752 --> 00:26:57.552 size:60%
Why did
you suddenly say to yourself...

519
00:26:57.985 --> 00:26:58.752 size:60%
“I think...

520
00:26:58.985 --> 00:27:01.518 size:60%
that I’m,
I’m gonna share in his delirium”?

521
00:27:01.885 --> 00:27:03.685 size:60%
Well, in the beginning...

522
00:27:03.885 --> 00:27:05.952 size:60%
when you and I met,
I saw your approach.

523
00:27:06.351 --> 00:27:08.819 size:60%
Okay, this guy doesn’t just want
to do Everest, he wants to...

524
00:27:09.418 --> 00:27:10.518 size:60%
discover the mountain.

525
00:27:10.885 --> 00:27:11.718 size:60%
So, basically...

526
00:27:11.952 --> 00:27:12.885 size:60%
I said to myself...

527
00:27:13.351 --> 00:27:14.485 size:60%
okay, the project is cool...

528
00:27:14.652 --> 00:27:16.985 size:60%
because you actually wanted
to discover the mountain...

529
00:27:17.518 --> 00:27:19.418 size:60%
and because you
wanted to go further...

530
00:27:19.485 --> 00:27:20.985 size:60%
than just reaching
Everest’s summit.

531
00:27:23.585 --> 00:27:24.752 size:60%
So, I think
that the path you chose to take,

532
00:27:24.819 --> 00:27:26.752 size:60%
that you agreed to take...

533
00:27:26.919 --> 00:27:28.418 size:60%
to me, it’s the right approach.

534
00:27:30.585 --> 00:27:31.318 size:60%
And I’m...

535
00:27:31.385 --> 00:27:33.585 size:60%
really happy with the
progress in our journey so far...

536
00:27:35.385 --> 00:27:36.985 size:60%
but this is only the
end of phase one.

537
00:27:38.418 --> 00:27:40.819 size:60%
We’ve done some of the highest
peaks we could do in the Alps,

538
00:27:40.885 --> 00:27:42.952 size:60%
so now, we have to
start the next phase...

539
00:27:43.418 --> 00:27:45.652 size:60%
heading to Nepal.
The hardest part is yet to come.

540
00:27:48.385 --> 00:27:49.485 size:60%
The hardest part is yet to come?

541
00:27:53.385 --> 00:27:54.351 size:60%
Ama Dablam.

542
00:27:54.718 --> 00:27:55.919 size:60%
6,812 meters.

543
00:27:56.585 --> 00:27:57.885 size:60%
It’s considered by many to be

544
00:27:57.919 --> 00:27:59.418 size:60%
the most beautiful
mountain in the world.

545
00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:03.385 size:60%
For our body to withstand
such an extreme altitude,

546
00:28:03.418 --> 00:28:05.819 size:60%
it will have to acclimatize
to the lack of oxygen.

547
00:28:06.585 --> 00:28:09.752 size:60%
So, we’re going to do a 10-day
trek in the Himalayan valley,

548
00:28:09.885 --> 00:28:11.418 size:60%
going from village to village,

549
00:28:11.451 --> 00:28:12.618 size:60%
to adjust to the altitude...

550
00:28:13.451 --> 00:28:14.952 size:60%
and thus reach the base camp,

551
00:28:14.985 --> 00:28:16.919 size:60%
where we will leave
to attempt the summit

552
00:28:16.985 --> 00:28:18.752 size:60%
without the help of oxygen tanks.

553
00:28:22.718 --> 00:28:24.552 size:60%
Inès has only 6
months of training...

554
00:28:24.819 --> 00:28:25.985 size:60%
and the challenge is immense.

555
00:28:27.985 --> 00:28:28.919 size:60%
We depart tomorrow!

556
00:28:30.418 --> 00:28:30.718 size:60%
Are you ready?

557
00:28:30.785 --> 00:28:32.652 size:60%
We depart tomorrow, but...
we’re ready.

558
00:28:32.785 --> 00:28:33.518 size:60%
You know what?

559
00:28:33.552 --> 00:28:36.618 size:60%
Yesterday, I went to a restaurant
with my dad and with my mom.

560
00:28:36.718 --> 00:28:37.752 size:60%
My dad’s really worried.

561
00:28:37.852 --> 00:28:39.518 size:60%
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, he’s really worried.

562
00:28:39.885 --> 00:28:41.785 size:60%
And he gave me a
fifty-minute speech!

563
00:28:42.552 --> 00:28:44.418 size:60%
I thought to myself,
I have to record this.

564
00:28:44.585 --> 00:28:45.385 size:60%
Because...

565
00:28:45.618 --> 00:28:46.518 size:60%
if one day

566
00:28:46.919 --> 00:28:47.852 size:60%
I’m in trouble,

567
00:28:47.919 --> 00:28:49.585 size:60%
or lacking
motivation, I’ll listen to it.

568
00:28:50.919 --> 00:28:51.785 size:60%
He told me, uh...

569
00:28:52.785 --> 00:28:54.819 size:60%
Well, I’ll play it to myself,
and...

570
00:28:55.418 --> 00:28:56.652 size:60%
it’ll remind me what he said.

571
00:28:57.385 --> 00:28:58.785 size:60%
-If you listen to it...
-Wait, you recorded

572
00:28:58.852 --> 00:28:59.652 size:60%
your father at the restaurant?

573
00:29:00.418 --> 00:29:01.585 size:60%
Without him knowing?

574
00:29:01.985 --> 00:29:03.385 size:60%
You see who you are today...

575
00:29:03.485 --> 00:29:04.652 size:60%
Man, I guarantee it.

576
00:29:04.952 --> 00:29:05.819 size:60%
I’m dead!

577
00:29:06.451 --> 00:29:08.652 size:60%
He’d kill me if
he knew I recorded what he said!

578
00:29:10.418 --> 00:29:10.985 size:60%
He was talking...

579
00:29:12.552 --> 00:29:13.952 size:60%
And he had tears in his eyes.

580
00:29:15.618 --> 00:29:16.985 size:60%
I could feel it. His voice was...

581
00:29:17.351 --> 00:29:17.852 size:60%
trembling, you know?

582
00:29:20.985 --> 00:29:22.885 size:60%
I realized
that they’re scared for me.

583
00:29:24.351 --> 00:29:24.885 size:60%
So, are you scared?

584
00:29:25.418 --> 00:29:27.752 size:60%
Me?! Are you crazy?
I can’t wait to be there!

585
00:29:30.885 --> 00:29:31.819 size:60%
Kisses.

586
00:29:32.585 --> 00:29:33.318 size:60%
Don’t worry, we’ll be back soon.

587
00:29:33.385 --> 00:29:34.552 size:60%
I’ll message you, I have 4G...

588
00:29:34.585 --> 00:29:36.885 size:60%
-but I won’t be on my phone much.
-Don’t worry! I understand.

589
00:29:36.919 --> 00:29:39.518 size:60%
-No stress, no stress...
-I’m not expecting any updates.

590
00:29:39.585 --> 00:29:40.985 size:60%
-I just want the good news.
-We’ll be back in a month.

591
00:29:41.485 --> 00:29:42.451 size:60%
In a month.

592
00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:49.552 size:60%
I think she
was stressed over you leaving.

593
00:29:49.618 --> 00:29:50.785 size:60%
Oh, yeah,
she was saying to me, like...

594
00:29:50.852 --> 00:29:53.451 size:60%
“You never know,
something might happen.”

595
00:29:55.451 --> 00:29:56.652 size:60%
But it’s going to be okay.

596
00:30:04.952 --> 00:30:05.785 size:60%
Go, go, go!

597
00:30:20.919 --> 00:30:22.351 size:60%
It’s such a big mess!

598
00:30:22.418 --> 00:30:24.385 size:60%
Everything is so messy, it’s
like my room...

599
00:30:24.585 --> 00:30:25.451 size:60%
but it’s a city!

600
00:30:25.819 --> 00:30:26.985 size:60%
What the hell is going on?!

601
00:30:27.819 --> 00:30:29.351 size:60%
The cows are
running into the door!

602
00:30:29.485 --> 00:30:30.618 size:60%
What the hell is going on?!

603
00:30:30.752 --> 00:30:33.518 size:60%
You see that?! Even the
cows are passing us by now!

604
00:30:35.418 --> 00:30:36.385 size:60%
Short, short, huh?

605
00:30:36.618 --> 00:30:37.451 size:60%
What a bastard.

606
00:30:40.418 --> 00:30:42.485 size:60%
Marion is going to smack
him when he goes home!

607
00:30:42.518 --> 00:30:43.518 size:60%
Oh, crap.

608
00:30:45.985 --> 00:30:46.852 size:60%
Oh, Mathis!

609
00:30:47.652 --> 00:30:48.952 size:60%
-Is it good or bad?
-Honestly...

610
00:30:48.985 --> 00:30:50.451 size:60%
the guy did you good.

611
00:30:50.485 --> 00:30:52.418 size:60%
All right, let’s go,
Mister Swiss.

612
00:30:52.685 --> 00:30:53.552 size:60%
I know...

613
00:30:53.585 --> 00:30:55.618 size:60%
it’s Tintin when
he gets back from the rocket.

614
00:30:55.685 --> 00:30:57.652 size:60%
-You think?
-You’re such a bastard, bro!

615
00:31:09.685 --> 00:31:12.351 size:60%
We grazed the ground!
Oh, that was crazy!

616
00:31:12.752 --> 00:31:14.351 size:60%
Here we go buddy!

617
00:31:18.885 --> 00:31:20.418 size:60%
Look how incredible it is!

618
00:31:20.618 --> 00:31:21.785 size:60%
You can see the whole city!

619
00:31:46.618 --> 00:31:48.518 size:60%
Today, we made the
trip from Kathmandu...

620
00:31:48.618 --> 00:31:49.552 size:60%
to Lukla.

621
00:31:49.652 --> 00:31:52.418 size:60%
We’re in the jungle
at a low altitude, about 2008.

622
00:31:52.685 --> 00:31:53.852 size:60%
Next, we’ll go up to Namche...

623
00:31:54.418 --> 00:31:56.451 size:60%
the Sherpa village,
the Sherpa capital.

624
00:31:56.552 --> 00:31:56.952 size:60%
I’m at...

625
00:31:57.652 --> 00:31:58.585 size:60%
100% battery!

626
00:31:58.819 --> 00:31:59.785 size:60%
I am at 100%, Mathis.

627
00:31:59.852 --> 00:32:02.418 size:60%
I’m at
100%, and I’ll stay at 100%!

628
00:32:03.351 --> 00:32:04.585 size:60%
-Awesome.
-All the way down the mountain!

629
00:32:04.718 --> 00:32:05.819 size:60%
And when I see Ama Dablam...

630
00:32:06.652 --> 00:32:06.985 size:60%
We go!

631
00:32:26.351 --> 00:32:27.518 size:60%
You know,
these are prayer wheels.

632
00:32:27.585 --> 00:32:28.585 size:60%
They’re prayer wheels?

633
00:32:28.718 --> 00:32:29.985 size:60%
Every time it turns,
it says a prayer.

634
00:32:30.585 --> 00:32:32.952 size:60%
You have to turn it clockwise...
always turn it clockwise.

635
00:32:46.585 --> 00:32:47.385 size:60%
I like it here.

636
00:32:47.485 --> 00:32:48.685 size:60%
It feels spiritual.

637
00:32:49.385 --> 00:32:50.318 size:60%
It makes me feel good.

638
00:32:50.985 --> 00:32:51.919 size:60%
I feel recharged.

639
00:32:55.552 --> 00:32:56.585 size:60%
In places like this...

640
00:32:57.418 --> 00:32:58.985 size:60%
I feel like I can
empty my mind...

641
00:33:00.418 --> 00:33:01.985 size:60%
like I don’t have to
think about anything.

642
00:33:03.718 --> 00:33:05.318 size:60%
I’m not here thinking about...

643
00:33:05.718 --> 00:33:06.919 size:60%
“What am I doing tomorrow?”

644
00:33:08.718 --> 00:33:09.952 size:60%
“Should I make a video?”

645
00:33:10.618 --> 00:33:12.518 size:60%
Thinking
about YouTube all the time...

646
00:33:14.885 --> 00:33:16.418 size:60%
So, I’m finally here...

647
00:33:17.418 --> 00:33:19.785 size:60%
and it’s amazing,
beyond my wildest dreams!

648
00:33:21.919 --> 00:33:23.652 size:60%
Now that I’m here
in the mountains...

649
00:33:27.385 --> 00:33:28.418 size:60%
There’s nothing else.

650
00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:34.618 size:60%
My brain is completely
focused on the present.

651
00:33:39.718 --> 00:33:40.985 size:60%
I think
that’s what life is about.

652
00:33:42.752 --> 00:33:44.819 size:60%
You have to, you have to
discover, and you have to...

653
00:33:45.952 --> 00:33:47.451 size:60%
You have to want to learn.

654
00:33:50.752 --> 00:33:52.852 size:60%
I don’t want to
stay in my bubble, in my cocoon.

655
00:33:56.785 --> 00:33:58.418 size:60%
I think, to find what you like...

656
00:33:58.451 --> 00:33:59.819 size:60%
to discover your passion...

657
00:34:01.485 --> 00:34:03.819 size:60%
You have to get up,
you have to stand up...

658
00:34:04.351 --> 00:34:06.618 size:60%
and turn off the TV
and go outside! And...

659
00:34:06.685 --> 00:34:08.819 size:60%
I don’t know,
you have to try things!

660
00:34:08.885 --> 00:34:10.451 size:60%
There are things that
cost nothing to try out.

661
00:34:36.451 --> 00:34:37.618 size:60%
-Hello!
-Hello.

662
00:34:37.718 --> 00:34:39.418 size:60%
-You good?
-Yeah, I’m good.

663
00:34:40.451 --> 00:34:41.985 size:60%
-So, you’ve climbed Everest?
-Yes, yes.

664
00:34:42.552 --> 00:34:44.351 size:60%
-He’s climbed it 12 times.
-12 times!

665
00:34:44.752 --> 00:34:46.752 size:60%
-12 times.
-You’ve gone to the top?

666
00:34:46.819 --> 00:34:47.518 size:60%
Yeah.

667
00:34:49.985 --> 00:34:51.418 size:60%
And he’s lost fingers.

668
00:34:53.785 --> 00:34:54.919 size:60%
It’s stuck now.

669
00:34:55.652 --> 00:34:56.785 size:60%
-Ah, he can’t move that finger.
-This finger as well.

670
00:34:56.852 --> 00:34:57.785 size:60%
And that one too.

671
00:34:57.819 --> 00:35:00.585 size:60%
-It’s gone too.
-He can’t feel anything.

672
00:35:00.618 --> 00:35:01.685 size:60%
Now there’s only four.

673
00:35:01.785 --> 00:35:03.919 size:60%
You can’t feel anything?
It’s gone now?

674
00:35:03.952 --> 00:35:04.985 size:60%
I think it’s all numb now.

675
00:35:05.418 --> 00:35:06.552 size:60%
When you lack oxygen...

676
00:35:06.585 --> 00:35:08.485 size:60%
the blood
doesn’t go to the extremities.

677
00:35:08.552 --> 00:35:09.819 size:60%
It goes to the vital points.

678
00:35:09.985 --> 00:35:11.718 size:60%
So, when
you go back down the mountain...

679
00:35:11.752 --> 00:35:13.752 size:60%
there’s a chance that
you might lose a finger.

680
00:35:13.952 --> 00:35:15.785 size:60%
Will you going to go back to
Everest, or are you stopping?

681
00:35:15.819 --> 00:35:16.785 size:60%
I’m going back.

682
00:35:16.985 --> 00:35:17.585 size:60%
Yeah.

683
00:35:18.418 --> 00:35:19.919 size:60%
He’ll try.
He’ll try again in Spring.

684
00:35:19.952 --> 00:35:21.718 size:60%
-In Spring. In Spring.
-Next Spring,

685
00:35:22.451 --> 00:35:23.618 size:60%
you’re to going back?

686
00:35:23.685 --> 00:35:24.885 size:60%
Yeah, he’s going back.
He’ll go back next year.

687
00:35:24.919 --> 00:35:27.552 size:60%
Going up Everest allows
him to support his family.

688
00:35:27.752 --> 00:35:28.752 size:60%
Otherwise...

689
00:35:28.819 --> 00:35:30.585 size:60%
he would never go just for fun,
you know?

690
00:35:30.718 --> 00:35:32.919 size:60%
He never says to himself “I
feel like climbing Everest.”

691
00:35:32.985 --> 00:35:33.919 size:60%
It’s to support his family.

692
00:35:33.952 --> 00:35:34.985 size:60%
It’s because he has no choice.

693
00:35:35.351 --> 00:35:37.752 size:60%
It’s a good source of
income in Nepal, so he does it.

694
00:35:40.351 --> 00:35:41.685 size:60%
For us Westerners...

695
00:35:41.985 --> 00:35:43.385 size:60%
we consider it a luxury.

696
00:35:44.318 --> 00:35:45.919 size:60%
It’s a dream to achieve,
an adventure...

697
00:35:46.685 --> 00:35:47.819 size:60%
because we can afford it.

698
00:35:48.685 --> 00:35:49.418 size:60%
But for him...

699
00:35:49.585 --> 00:35:50.418 size:60%
it’s different.

700
00:35:50.819 --> 00:35:51.819 size:60%
It’s for survival.

701
00:35:52.718 --> 00:35:54.485 size:60%
We go there for fun!

702
00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:56.451 size:60%
And he goes so he can eat.

703
00:36:08.585 --> 00:36:10.585 size:60%
-Namaste!
-Namaste!

704
00:36:10.618 --> 00:36:11.752 size:60%
Do you know YouTube?

705
00:36:12.919 --> 00:36:14.418 size:60%
-Yes! Yes!
-That’s right!

706
00:36:17.718 --> 00:36:18.752 size:60%
She’s making fun of me.

707
00:36:20.919 --> 00:36:22.485 size:60%
You see how she’s
making fun of me?!

708
00:36:33.618 --> 00:36:34.451 size:60%
Manish!

709
00:36:37.919 --> 00:36:38.852 size:60%
And...

710
00:36:39.385 --> 00:36:42.385 size:60%
Manish is our Nepalese cameraman,
and he’ll be joining us.

711
00:36:42.418 --> 00:36:43.451 size:60%
How ya doin’?

712
00:36:43.785 --> 00:36:46.819 size:60%
-Are you good? “I’m good!”
-I’m good!

713
00:36:46.852 --> 00:36:48.718 size:60%
-I’m good! I’m good!
-I’m good!

714
00:36:48.752 --> 00:36:49.985 size:60%
There you go! “I’m good!”

715
00:36:50.585 --> 00:36:52.418 size:60%
And there’s Ila Nuru...
our local guide.

716
00:36:52.618 --> 00:36:53.985 size:60%
Ila Nuru, lent me his glasses.

717
00:36:54.919 --> 00:36:56.652 size:60%
And Dorji... the lead Sherpa.

718
00:36:56.819 --> 00:36:58.518 size:60%
And he’s climbed
Everest 19 times.

719
00:36:58.585 --> 00:37:01.752 size:60%
He invited us over. Awesome!
Would you look at that?

720
00:37:01.885 --> 00:37:03.585 size:60%
Mind your head! Be careful!

721
00:37:04.819 --> 00:37:06.718 size:60%
-Jeez, Dorji!
-I warned you!

722
00:37:07.652 --> 00:37:08.819 size:60%
Hey listen, Dorji...

723
00:37:10.752 --> 00:37:11.451 size:60%
Looks good.

724
00:37:11.752 --> 00:37:13.585 size:60%
She’s
cooking potatoes from the garden.

725
00:37:16.785 --> 00:37:18.718 size:60%
-Are you vegetarian?
-Yeah.

726
00:37:18.852 --> 00:37:20.819 size:60%
-You can’t kill anything.
-Yeah, because...

727
00:37:20.919 --> 00:37:23.785 size:60%
everybody
is connected to all species.

728
00:37:24.485 --> 00:37:25.885 size:60%
-So, you’re vegetarians.
-Yeah.

729
00:37:26.852 --> 00:37:28.919 size:60%
You too Ila Nuru? You veg?

730
00:37:29.885 --> 00:37:30.785 size:60%
Veggies and meat.

731
00:37:38.418 --> 00:37:40.752 size:60%
That dude is hilarious!
Ila Nuru is so funny!

732
00:37:41.318 --> 00:37:42.819 size:60%
-Fifty, fifty.
-He answered the question.

733
00:37:42.852 --> 00:37:44.552 size:60%
Veggies and meat!

734
00:37:46.919 --> 00:37:49.351 size:60%
And as usual,
I’m accompanied by Mathis.

735
00:37:49.919 --> 00:37:51.952 size:60%
And Jordan,
who’s here to film with Manish.

736
00:37:52.985 --> 00:37:54.718 size:60%
And Samy, in production.

737
00:37:55.885 --> 00:37:56.919 size:60%
And there’s Léo Slemett,

738
00:37:56.952 --> 00:37:58.451 size:60%
world ski champion,

739
00:37:58.585 --> 00:38:00.618 size:60%
who was there during my
first mountaineering session.

740
00:38:00.919 --> 00:38:02.418 size:60%
Let’s hit Ama Dablam!

741
00:38:02.418 --> 00:38:03.785 size:60%
When I met you 4 months ago,

742
00:38:03.852 --> 00:38:05.885 size:60%
I never thought I’d
be going with you to Ama Dablam.

743
00:38:07.351 --> 00:38:08.451 size:60%
What a bastard!

744
00:38:22.985 --> 00:38:24.752 size:60%
Whoa, bro!
We’re going to climb that?

745
00:38:24.785 --> 00:38:25.585 size:60%
Yes!

746
00:38:25.618 --> 00:38:26.919 size:60%
We’re
really going to climb that?!

747
00:38:33.518 --> 00:38:36.785 size:60%
No, way! It’s crazy!
Just look at it, it’s a pyramid!

748
00:38:36.819 --> 00:38:38.451 size:60%
-Oh, it’s so crazy!
-It’s great.

749
00:38:45.985 --> 00:38:48.919 size:60%
Ama Dablam. Look at that!
The summit is scary!

750
00:38:48.985 --> 00:38:50.819 size:60%
-Yeah, it’s scary.
-Oh, it’s so scary!

751
00:38:50.919 --> 00:38:51.752 size:60%
I admit that I’ve...

752
00:38:51.819 --> 00:38:53.919 size:60%
seen a lot of mountains,
but I’m excited about this one.

753
00:38:54.585 --> 00:38:56.752 size:60%
This one’s gonna be amazing!

754
00:38:56.819 --> 00:38:59.552 size:60%
You know, Chamonix is
scary in Europe, but this is a...

755
00:38:59.585 --> 00:39:01.518 size:60%
whole other level.
To me, it’s like...

756
00:39:07.351 --> 00:39:08.518 size:60%
I’m afraid of one thing...

757
00:39:08.952 --> 00:39:09.852 size:60%
not being up there.

758
00:39:10.652 --> 00:39:12.351 size:60%
I can’t guarantee that I won’t...

759
00:39:12.418 --> 00:39:14.985 size:60%
get a headache,
or get diarrhea, I don’t know.

760
00:39:15.752 --> 00:39:16.919 size:60%
Are you, are you sure
you want to be up there?

761
00:39:16.985 --> 00:39:18.552 size:60%
I’m sure I want to be up there.

762
00:39:18.752 --> 00:39:19.752 size:60%
You’re having doubts,

763
00:39:19.819 --> 00:39:21.418 size:60%
and you want to know
if it’ll affect your body.

764
00:39:21.585 --> 00:39:21.919 size:60%
Yeah.

765
00:39:22.652 --> 00:39:23.485 size:60%
I get it.

766
00:39:25.819 --> 00:39:27.652 size:60%
I would rather
conquer this one over Everest.

767
00:39:27.885 --> 00:39:29.585 size:60%
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, it’s really beautiful.

768
00:39:29.852 --> 00:39:31.819 size:60%
Remember when you made the...
announcement about Everest?

769
00:39:31.885 --> 00:39:33.418 size:60%
I made a mistake
and put that one!

770
00:39:33.451 --> 00:39:34.385 size:60%
You got the wrong mountain!

771
00:39:36.685 --> 00:39:37.819 size:60%
It’s a sign, it was written...

772
00:39:37.885 --> 00:39:39.618 size:60%
so we have to climb it, bro.

773
00:39:39.752 --> 00:39:41.919 size:60%
Many people think it’s the most
beautiful mountain in the world.

774
00:39:43.919 --> 00:39:46.518 size:60%
As you can see, under the
last slope there’s a kind of...

775
00:39:46.585 --> 00:39:48.351 size:60%
of serac that looks threatening.

776
00:39:48.585 --> 00:39:49.785 size:60%
It actually
collapsed last spring.

777
00:39:49.852 --> 00:39:50.952 size:60%
It was at the base camp.

778
00:39:50.985 --> 00:39:52.585 size:60%
Yeah,
look at the valley it created.

779
00:39:55.819 --> 00:39:57.552 size:60%
Listen to
the noise it’s making...

780
00:40:01.752 --> 00:40:03.418 size:60%
-Now that’s scary, right?
-Yeah.

781
00:40:03.552 --> 00:40:03.985 size:60%
Yeah!

782
00:40:04.618 --> 00:40:06.585 size:60%
Dorji, were you at the base
camp filming the video?

783
00:40:06.618 --> 00:40:07.485 size:60%
-Yeah.
-Okay.

784
00:40:07.752 --> 00:40:08.552 size:60%
That’s crazy...

785
00:40:08.585 --> 00:40:10.418 size:60%
Even if the snow doesn’t hit you,
it can be hard to breathe.

786
00:40:10.485 --> 00:40:12.618 size:60%
It moves so much air,
that you just feel it go...

787
00:40:12.685 --> 00:40:13.819 size:60%
Right. You know, it can ravage

788
00:40:13.885 --> 00:40:15.418 size:60%
the base
camp and people get killed.

789
00:40:16.418 --> 00:40:16.919 size:60%
It’s scary.

790
00:40:19.919 --> 00:40:21.451 size:60%
We’re gonna do Ama Dablam!

791
00:40:21.518 --> 00:40:22.485 size:60%
6800 meters!

792
00:40:22.518 --> 00:40:23.952 size:60%
The highest
mountain that I’ve ever climbed!

793
00:40:25.418 --> 00:40:26.752 size:60%
It’s absolutely insane!

794
00:40:27.585 --> 00:40:29.585 size:60%
I’m feeling good!

795
00:40:31.752 --> 00:40:33.552 size:60%
Right, Manish?
Break the record again!

796
00:40:33.618 --> 00:40:34.585 size:60%
Summit!

797
00:40:34.618 --> 00:40:36.585 size:60%
-Are you good?
-Yeah, I’m good!

798
00:40:36.652 --> 00:40:38.418 size:60%
Where are the fashionistas?

799
00:40:38.451 --> 00:40:39.852 size:60%
Where are the fashionistas?

800
00:40:42.451 --> 00:40:43.819 size:60%
He’s so strong! He did eight.

801
00:40:43.919 --> 00:40:45.685 size:60%
One final message, yeah!

802
00:40:45.752 --> 00:40:46.952 size:60%
One final message, yeah!

803
00:40:46.985 --> 00:40:48.718 size:60%
And this is how
you skip a stone!

804
00:40:51.952 --> 00:40:53.985 size:60%
Wait a sec...
That’s stone skipping?

805
00:40:55.418 --> 00:40:55.785 size:60%
Yeah!

806
00:40:57.718 --> 00:40:59.418 size:60%
It’s time to commit a murder!

807
00:40:59.518 --> 00:41:01.752 size:60%
-Are you good?
-Yeah, I’m good!

808
00:41:05.919 --> 00:41:07.418 size:60%
-That sounds good.
-Okay.

809
00:41:07.585 --> 00:41:09.685 size:60%
All right, you’re up next.

810
00:41:14.318 --> 00:41:14.985 size:60%
Eight, nine...

811
00:41:18.552 --> 00:41:19.618 size:60%
And...

812
00:41:19.685 --> 00:41:21.318 size:60%
-one more card.
-Now it’s your turn.

813
00:41:22.919 --> 00:41:24.585 size:60%
Dude it’s
almost too hot in here.

814
00:41:24.585 --> 00:41:26.785 size:60%
-Okay, I got a 12.
-Okay, I have a 6.

815
00:41:26.819 --> 00:41:28.919 size:60%
All right,
so what card do you have now?

816
00:41:29.718 --> 00:41:30.385 size:60%
A 9.

817
00:41:30.418 --> 00:41:31.418 size:60%
-And you?
-20.

818
00:41:56.552 --> 00:41:58.652 size:60%
I feel really sick.
I’m sure it’s a virus.

819
00:41:58.685 --> 00:42:00.451 size:60%
-It might be the altitude.
-No...

820
00:42:01.819 --> 00:42:02.919 size:60%
I had the same thing in Paris.

821
00:42:05.318 --> 00:42:07.418 size:60%
-I will come back.
-You’re strong, man.

822
00:42:08.418 --> 00:42:10.752 size:60%
-We’ll go to the summit, man.
-Yes, sir!

823
00:42:10.819 --> 00:42:12.919 size:60%
-Nobody will stop me.
-Nobody!

824
00:42:12.919 --> 00:42:14.418 size:60%
-Nobody!
-Nobody!

825
00:42:14.451 --> 00:42:15.518 size:60%
I will come again, man!

826
00:42:15.585 --> 00:42:16.618 size:60%
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

827
00:42:16.685 --> 00:42:17.518 size:60%
He’s already coming back!

828
00:42:17.585 --> 00:42:19.718 size:60%
-Yeah, I’m coming back.
-I can see that smile!

829
00:42:19.752 --> 00:42:20.652 size:60%
Yeah, smile!

830
00:42:24.752 --> 00:42:25.952 size:60%
I know I shouldn’t be sick.

831
00:42:28.685 --> 00:42:29.985 size:60%
I just had to get sick...

832
00:42:32.485 --> 00:42:33.685 size:60%
I had to get sick right now!

833
00:42:34.318 --> 00:42:35.585 size:60%
One day before, man!

834
00:42:36.718 --> 00:42:38.819 size:60%
It’s not like I got
sick 6 days ago...

835
00:42:39.718 --> 00:42:41.985 size:60%
so I could have time to recover!

836
00:42:42.985 --> 00:42:44.752 size:60%
I got sick one day before!

837
00:42:46.385 --> 00:42:49.418 size:60%
It’s driving me crazy!
I’m so upset.

838
00:42:54.585 --> 00:42:56.451 size:60%
I’m not
gonna be better in 4 days.

839
00:43:01.752 --> 00:43:03.552 size:60%
I can’t believe
this is happening.

840
00:43:05.618 --> 00:43:06.852 size:60%
We can do one night there...

841
00:43:06.919 --> 00:43:08.485 size:60%
tomorrow we’ll see how you are.

842
00:43:08.985 --> 00:43:10.418 size:60%
If you’re
not well in the morning,

843
00:43:10.451 --> 00:43:11.852 size:60%
we’ll take the day off. Okay?

844
00:43:12.752 --> 00:43:14.418 size:60%
If things don’t look good,

845
00:43:14.451 --> 00:43:15.585 size:60%
we’ll decide whether we should

846
00:43:15.652 --> 00:43:16.752 size:60%
go back down or
even just give up.

847
00:43:16.985 --> 00:43:18.418 size:60%
We’re not going to put ourselves

848
00:43:18.451 --> 00:43:19.819 size:60%
in danger
or mess up our health...

849
00:43:20.585 --> 00:43:21.952 size:60%
for a mountain that will still

850
00:43:21.985 --> 00:43:23.652 size:60%
be there in 10 or 20 years.

851
00:43:23.919 --> 00:43:24.952 size:60%
That’s how it goes,

852
00:43:24.985 --> 00:43:26.852 size:60%
sometimes it
works out, sometimes it doesn’t.

853
00:43:27.585 --> 00:43:28.785 size:60%
Sometimes our
bodies let us down,

854
00:43:28.852 --> 00:43:29.885 size:60%
sometimes it’s the weather,

855
00:43:29.919 --> 00:43:31.418 size:60%
there are a thousand reasons,

856
00:43:31.451 --> 00:43:33.785 size:60%
there are a billion
expeditions that have failed.

857
00:43:34.952 --> 00:43:36.351 size:60%
You know, we shouldn’t...

858
00:43:36.585 --> 00:43:37.819 size:60%
We shouldn’t
beat ourselves up if it

859
00:43:37.885 --> 00:43:39.451 size:60%
doesn’t work out, alright?
It’s okay.

860
00:43:40.752 --> 00:43:42.952 size:60%
-But we’ll try to make it work.
-It’s a tricky situation.

861
00:43:58.351 --> 00:43:59.418 size:60%
So, we got up there...

862
00:43:59.585 --> 00:44:01.752 size:60%
and we realized that
Jordan was feeling really sick.

863
00:44:02.919 --> 00:44:03.919 size:60%
He’s not doing well.

864
00:44:04.919 --> 00:44:07.518 size:60%
I had a sore throat and Jordan’s
had a headache for 2-3 days.

865
00:44:07.585 --> 00:44:08.985 size:60%
Me too,
but he’s worse than yesterday.

866
00:44:09.385 --> 00:44:10.585 size:60%
We can’t get
in touch with the insurance...

867
00:44:10.685 --> 00:44:12.385 size:60%
to get them to send a helicopter.

868
00:44:12.485 --> 00:44:13.585 size:60%
I’ll send
you everything on WhatsApp.

869
00:44:40.819 --> 00:44:41.652 size:60%
It’s going by fast, huh?

870
00:44:42.852 --> 00:44:44.485 size:60%
-Just one more day.
-One more day.

871
00:44:44.552 --> 00:44:44.919 size:60%
One more day.

872
00:44:45.418 --> 00:44:46.552 size:60%
This morning when he walked out,

873
00:44:46.585 --> 00:44:48.819 size:60%
I saw his face and thought,
“He doesn’t look good.”

874
00:44:48.952 --> 00:44:50.752 size:60%
Things don’t always go as
planned, right?

875
00:44:52.752 --> 00:44:53.618 size:60%
Unfortunately.

876
00:44:56.618 --> 00:44:58.552 size:60%
It’s hard to think that I
came here for nothing.

877
00:45:08.418 --> 00:45:09.952 size:60%
I will come back, Manish.

878
00:45:25.485 --> 00:45:26.985 size:60%
I don’t know if I
can eat anything,

879
00:45:27.351 --> 00:45:28.351 size:60%
I’m not hungry anymore...

880
00:45:30.819 --> 00:45:31.852 size:60%
It’s so annoying...

881
00:45:35.752 --> 00:45:37.852 size:60%
-So, Jordan has Covid.
-Aw, he’s got Covid?

882
00:45:38.418 --> 00:45:39.451 size:60%
He has really bad COVID

883
00:45:41.418 --> 00:45:43.351 size:60%
That means
that we might have Covid.

884
00:45:43.518 --> 00:45:44.618 size:60%
I think we all have
Covid if he has Covid.

885
00:45:44.685 --> 00:45:46.518 size:60%
Yeah, we all have Covid,
I guarantee it.

886
00:45:47.718 --> 00:45:48.518 size:60%
Dammit!

887
00:45:49.552 --> 00:45:50.785 size:60%
Goddamn Covid...

888
00:46:09.819 --> 00:46:11.919 size:60%
-Did the helicopter crash?!
-The helicopter crashed.

889
00:46:13.819 --> 00:46:14.952 size:60%
No!

890
00:46:17.585 --> 00:46:19.585 size:60%
Holy shit, man!

891
00:46:21.518 --> 00:46:23.385 size:60%
Shit, bro,
I hope no one in there!

892
00:46:23.585 --> 00:46:24.819 size:60%
There was
probably someone in there!

893
00:46:24.885 --> 00:46:26.385 size:60%
The pilot, at the very least.

894
00:46:43.785 --> 00:46:45.752 size:60%
We got news from the pilot,
the pilot’s okay.

895
00:46:46.585 --> 00:46:48.819 size:60%
He managed to get out
before it happened. But...

896
00:46:48.885 --> 00:46:50.885 size:60%
Dude, I’ve never seen a
helicopter crash, you know?

897
00:46:54.618 --> 00:46:56.885 size:60%
In fact, helicopters up
here don’t get any lift.

898
00:46:57.451 --> 00:46:58.418 size:60%
When they take off...

899
00:46:58.585 --> 00:46:59.819 size:60%
since we’re 5000 meters up,

900
00:46:59.885 --> 00:47:01.985 size:60%
they really
can’t get too far off the ground.

901
00:47:03.318 --> 00:47:05.318 size:60%
So, they skim the
ground until a lower elevation...

902
00:47:06.418 --> 00:47:08.485 size:60%
and sometimes they hit the side,
so, you know...

903
00:47:10.685 --> 00:47:12.919 size:60%
That helicopter could have been
Jordan’s helicopter yesterday.

904
00:47:13.652 --> 00:47:15.652 size:60%
We’ve entered
a vicious circle of madness.

905
00:47:17.418 --> 00:47:18.552 size:60%
I’m sick as a dog...

906
00:47:20.919 --> 00:47:22.718 size:60%
Jordan had to go...

907
00:47:24.919 --> 00:47:26.351 size:60%
The helicopter crashed...

908
00:47:26.785 --> 00:47:28.385 size:60%
Man, it sucks.

909
00:47:29.351 --> 00:47:30.752 size:60%
Jeez, we’re in a real mess.

910
00:47:34.752 --> 00:47:36.685 size:60%
As soon as I’m better,
we’re going to do this

911
00:47:36.752 --> 00:47:37.752 size:60%
goddamn summit, bro.

912
00:47:38.385 --> 00:47:39.718 size:60%
Yeah. Don’t worry, we’ll do it.

913
00:47:39.819 --> 00:47:40.785 size:60%
We have to!

914
00:47:41.318 --> 00:47:43.418 size:60%
If we weren’t stuck like this,
we’d have been done by now.

915
00:47:43.919 --> 00:47:45.819 size:60%
Before getting to the lodge,
I was like, “It’s over.

916
00:47:45.919 --> 00:47:47.518 size:60%
There’s no way I can do this,
man.

917
00:47:48.752 --> 00:47:49.919 size:60%
” Now,
I’m determined to do it again.

918
00:47:49.952 --> 00:47:51.418 size:60%
There has to be a way, bro.

919
00:47:52.385 --> 00:47:53.518 size:60%
Of course there’s a way.

920
00:47:53.552 --> 00:47:55.385 size:60%
-Objective reinstated.
-All right...

921
00:47:55.418 --> 00:47:56.418 size:60%
Okay, so look, it’s...

922
00:47:56.819 --> 00:47:58.418 size:60%
It’s Saturday the 14th.

923
00:47:58.685 --> 00:48:00.552 size:60%
What’s the
recovery deadline Mathis?

924
00:48:00.685 --> 00:48:02.985 size:60%
Don’t go falling asleep
on us now, okay, bro?

925
00:48:03.518 --> 00:48:05.485 size:60%
They said you shouldn’t
do anything for 3 or 4 days.

926
00:48:05.718 --> 00:48:07.819 size:60%
But you think we should
head out in 2 days instead?

927
00:48:08.718 --> 00:48:09.418 size:60%
Yeah!

928
00:48:09.919 --> 00:48:11.385 size:60%
I won’t be in good shape yet!

929
00:48:12.418 --> 00:48:14.552 size:60%
It’ll go quickly, in one or
two days you’ll feel better.

930
00:48:14.618 --> 00:48:15.618 size:60%
No, no, you guys.

931
00:48:15.852 --> 00:48:17.752 size:60%
Let me rest get
some rest, dude. Bro, come on.

932
00:48:17.785 --> 00:48:19.585 size:60%
You don’t need rest.
Get up and go.

933
00:48:20.351 --> 00:48:21.718 size:60%
But my throat’s really on fire!

934
00:48:21.852 --> 00:48:23.985 size:60%
You’re going to climb it anyway.
Right?

935
00:48:24.819 --> 00:48:26.451 size:60%
Léo’s such a bastard, man!

936
00:48:26.485 --> 00:48:27.919 size:60%
-I know.
-I have Covid, but he’s all...

937
00:48:27.952 --> 00:48:30.485 size:60%
Aw, stop complaining
about your throat, we don’t care.

938
00:48:30.552 --> 00:48:31.585 size:60%
Stop indulging yourself.

939
00:48:31.618 --> 00:48:32.785 size:60%
We’re going to put one
foot in front of the other

940
00:48:32.852 --> 00:48:34.585 size:60%
like we always do,
and we’re going to climb.

941
00:48:44.919 --> 00:48:47.685 size:60%
Base camp! Here we are, guys.

942
00:48:47.919 --> 00:48:48.752 size:60%
I can’t wait.

943
00:48:49.385 --> 00:48:50.552 size:60%
You know I’m really
looking forward to this.

944
00:48:50.585 --> 00:48:52.985 size:60%
I’ve never been so excited
to climb a fucking mountain.

945
00:48:55.785 --> 00:48:57.485 size:60%
Welcome back!

946
00:48:57.752 --> 00:48:59.852 size:60%
Yeah, surprise, surprise,
mother fucker!

947
00:49:00.351 --> 00:49:00.852 size:60%
I’m back!

948
00:49:02.852 --> 00:49:05.952 size:60%
Welcome back! Jordan is back!

949
00:49:06.119 --> 00:49:08.385 size:60%
Dude, how’s Kathmandu?
Did you get some air, or not?

950
00:49:08.451 --> 00:49:09.785 size:60%
-Yeah, for sure.
-Oh, yeah?

951
00:49:10.119 --> 00:49:11.952 size:60%
That’s it!
The misfortunes are over.

952
00:49:12.351 --> 00:49:15.119 size:60%
I’m in a good mood. We’re
going to climb like titans...

953
00:49:15.351 --> 00:49:18.418 size:60%
This is the final stretch...
We have 2,200 meters to climb...

954
00:49:18.485 --> 00:49:21.652 size:60%
and nothing can stop me now!
I’m going to the summit for sure.

955
00:49:22.119 --> 00:49:22.919 size:60%
I’ve got this.

956
00:49:23.952 --> 00:49:26.351 size:60%
Starting at the base camp,
we’ll head towards Camp 1.

957
00:49:26.518 --> 00:49:29.518 size:60%
Then, we’ll have to cross to Camp
2, where we’ll spend the night.

958
00:49:29.819 --> 00:49:32.385 size:60%
We’ll wake up at two in the
morning and head to Camp 3.

959
00:49:32.451 --> 00:49:33.485 size:60%
Then the last step...

960
00:49:33.819 --> 00:49:34.485 size:60%
is the summit.

961
00:49:36.952 --> 00:49:38.019 size:60%
Damn, you guys!

962
00:49:38.518 --> 00:49:39.451 size:60%
We’re gonna climb the most
beautiful

963
00:49:39.518 --> 00:49:41.752 size:60%
mountain in the Himalayas,
I don’t know if you realize that.

964
00:50:00.618 --> 00:50:01.785 size:60%
Ama Dablam.

965
00:50:01.985 --> 00:50:03.652 size:60%
Let’s see if anyone is awake.

966
00:50:03.952 --> 00:50:05.785 size:60%
All right, they’re awake!

967
00:50:06.019 --> 00:50:07.718 size:60%
They’re all awake, you guys!

968
00:50:07.985 --> 00:50:08.552 size:60%
What’s up?

969
00:50:08.819 --> 00:50:10.119 size:60%
-Are you good?
-How are you?

970
00:50:10.418 --> 00:50:11.385 size:60%
-Great.
-You sleep well?

971
00:50:11.718 --> 00:50:13.451 size:60%
Yeah, I slept well. It’s D-Day!

972
00:50:13.685 --> 00:50:15.052 size:60%
-D-Day.
-Let’s go!

973
00:50:16.418 --> 00:50:17.085 size:60%
Let’s do this.

974
00:50:18.451 --> 00:50:19.119 size:60%
Good luck.

975
00:50:28.785 --> 00:50:29.652 size:60%
All right.

976
00:51:15.351 --> 00:51:16.418 size:60%
We’re at Camp 1.

977
00:51:19.585 --> 00:51:20.552 size:60%
Wow that was tough.

978
00:51:20.752 --> 00:51:22.618 size:60%
-Yeah, it was really tough!
-This is no joke. Am I right?

979
00:51:22.752 --> 00:51:25.085 size:60%
It took us...
4 hours, 4 and a half hours.

980
00:51:25.418 --> 00:51:27.119 size:60%
-4 and half is a lot, huh?
-Yeah.

981
00:51:29.485 --> 00:51:30.485 size:60%
It’s all in the mind.

982
00:51:32.085 --> 00:51:33.752 size:60%
But we’re all determined.

983
00:51:35.618 --> 00:51:36.919 size:60%
And I’m not gonna stop here.

984
00:51:39.019 --> 00:51:40.885 size:60%
We’re
going to head to Camp 2 next.

985
00:51:47.718 --> 00:51:49.585 size:60%
-This is some climb.
-Yeah.

986
00:51:50.451 --> 00:51:51.819 size:60%
It’s steeper
than the Matterhorn.

987
00:51:51.885 --> 00:51:52.518 size:60%
Yeah.

988
00:52:00.518 --> 00:52:02.385 size:60%
-Am I good here?
-You’re perfect.

989
00:52:11.985 --> 00:52:14.485 size:60%
Dorji the
madman has 30 kilos on his back.

990
00:52:14.552 --> 00:52:18.019 size:60%
-How much do we have, Mathis? 10?
-15 or 20.

991
00:52:18.885 --> 00:52:21.385 size:60%
-Is the rock holding? Okay.
-Come on.

992
00:52:27.418 --> 00:52:28.518 size:60%
Look at that drop!

993
00:52:30.518 --> 00:52:31.485 size:60%
Look at all the clouds.

994
00:52:33.418 --> 00:52:34.885 size:60%
I’ve never seen so many clouds,
Mathis.

995
00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:36.351 size:60%
There’s are a lot of clouds.

996
00:52:39.019 --> 00:52:40.385 size:60%
-Are you Swiss?
-Yeah.

997
00:52:40.752 --> 00:52:43.585 size:60%
We even meet
subscribers up on Ama Dablam.

998
00:52:43.685 --> 00:52:45.451 size:60%
-Did you do the summit?
-Yeah!

999
00:52:45.485 --> 00:52:47.019 size:60%
-And?
-I did it this morning.

1000
00:52:47.085 --> 00:52:48.418 size:60%
I don’t want to scare you,
man...

1001
00:52:48.485 --> 00:52:50.752 size:60%
but when
I saw in your and Mathis’

1002
00:52:50.819 --> 00:52:53.518 size:60%
stories that you were doing this
one, I thought... “Goddamn, bro!”

1003
00:52:54.318 --> 00:52:56.618 size:60%
All the naysayers
who say that Everest

1004
00:52:56.685 --> 00:52:58.019 size:60%
is a cash machine,
that it’s for tourists,

1005
00:52:58.085 --> 00:52:58.985 size:60%
and all that, well...

1006
00:52:59.052 --> 00:53:00.618 size:60%
All the ones you’re
doing before Everest...

1007
00:53:00.919 --> 00:53:02.351 size:60%
are a thousand times harder.

1008
00:53:03.385 --> 00:53:06.085 size:60%
So, they’re worse than it in,
uh, in terms of elevation?

1009
00:53:06.351 --> 00:53:08.718 size:60%
What comes between
Camp 2 and 3 is way harder.

1010
00:53:08.752 --> 00:53:09.952 size:60%
Yeah,
but it’s not as steep, right?

1011
00:53:09.985 --> 00:53:10.985 size:60%
Yes, yeah!

1012
00:53:11.052 --> 00:53:12.852 size:60%
It seems endless,
but at least there’s snow.

1013
00:53:12.919 --> 00:53:15.819 size:60%
Starting at Camp 2, it’s vertical
all the way to the summit.

1014
00:53:16.385 --> 00:53:18.718 size:60%
-So, so, you know...
-How reassuring!

1015
00:53:35.952 --> 00:53:36.852 size:60%
You good, Mathis?

1016
00:53:37.418 --> 00:53:38.885 size:60%
I can’t get any slack!
I’m going crazy.

1017
00:53:38.952 --> 00:53:39.952 size:60%
Yeah, it’s pretty hard.

1018
00:53:43.919 --> 00:53:45.418 size:60%
This is scary, bro!

1019
00:54:16.552 --> 00:54:17.652 size:60%
Come on!

1020
00:54:17.819 --> 00:54:18.618 size:60%
Yes!

1021
00:54:22.685 --> 00:54:24.485 size:60%
-Yes!
-Good job, bro!

1022
00:54:24.652 --> 00:54:25.585 size:60%
Camp 2!

1023
00:54:25.919 --> 00:54:27.785 size:60%
Camp 2, we did it.

1024
00:54:42.019 --> 00:54:43.351 size:60%
What the hell am I doing...

1025
00:54:43.418 --> 00:54:45.085 size:60%
on a goddamn cliff...

1026
00:54:45.819 --> 00:54:48.952 size:60%
with a drop of I don’t know how
many meters, in a suspended tent?

1027
00:54:50.418 --> 00:54:51.819 size:60%
Well, the tent is suspended
there for the time being.

1028
00:54:51.852 --> 00:54:53.552 size:60%
Yeah, the tent is iconic.

1029
00:54:54.019 --> 00:54:55.485 size:60%
The tent is iconic.

1030
00:54:55.618 --> 00:54:57.085 size:60%
With 3 of in there,
I think we’ll be fine.

1031
00:54:57.451 --> 00:55:00.119 size:60%
-Life is beautiful, huh?
-It’s incredible.

1032
00:55:00.351 --> 00:55:01.385 size:60%
It’s really beautiful.

1033
00:55:06.119 --> 00:55:07.785 size:60%
Samy to Inès, can you hear me?

1034
00:55:11.485 --> 00:55:12.852 size:60%
I got to Camp 2, bro.

1035
00:55:15.685 --> 00:55:17.919 size:60%
We’re going to go to sleep soon,
so we’ll eat...

1036
00:55:18.785 --> 00:55:19.752 size:60%
and then sleep.

1037
00:55:24.418 --> 00:55:25.351 size:60%
And how’s your morale?

1038
00:55:25.385 --> 00:55:26.718 size:60%
How’s it
going? How’s your fatigue doing?

1039
00:55:32.585 --> 00:55:33.451 size:60%
It’s okay, bro.

1040
00:55:33.718 --> 00:55:34.585 size:60%
I’m hanging in there.

1041
00:55:35.585 --> 00:55:37.418 size:60%
I can see the summit,
but it’s still pretty far.

1042
00:55:40.618 --> 00:55:41.652 size:60%
It’s been tough, so far.

1043
00:55:41.785 --> 00:55:42.985 size:60%
-It’s tough?
-Yeah.

1044
00:55:44.819 --> 00:55:45.885 size:60%
It’s tough, but...

1045
00:55:47.119 --> 00:55:48.985 size:60%
I’m told the
fatigue will go, that it’ll pass.

1046
00:55:50.385 --> 00:55:51.718 size:60%
We have to hang in there...

1047
00:55:52.919 --> 00:55:53.652 size:60%
and...

1048
00:55:54.919 --> 00:55:55.785 size:60%
we’ll get there.

1049
00:55:57.819 --> 00:55:59.919 size:60%
What does the Air Up bottle say?
Does it work at 6,000 meters?

1050
00:56:00.019 --> 00:56:02.885 size:60%
Yeah, it works great.
There’s hot water.

1051
00:56:07.552 --> 00:56:09.385 size:60%
I hope I can make it to the top,
Jordan.

1052
00:56:09.752 --> 00:56:10.718 size:60%
Of course you will.

1053
00:56:11.852 --> 00:56:14.485 size:60%
You’re at 6000 meters,
you only have 800 left.

1054
00:56:15.819 --> 00:56:18.685 size:60%
You got this.
Actually, it’s just 700 meters.

1055
00:56:19.752 --> 00:56:20.685 size:60%
700...

1056
00:56:23.985 --> 00:56:25.318 size:60%
We’re not giving up, bro.

1057
00:56:25.585 --> 00:56:26.351 size:60%
Yeah...

1058
00:56:27.552 --> 00:56:28.585 size:60%
We’re not giving up.

1059
00:56:50.385 --> 00:56:51.718 size:60%
It’s 2:30.

1060
00:56:53.618 --> 00:56:54.585 size:60%
Two-thirty in the morning...

1061
00:56:56.019 --> 00:56:57.785 size:60%
we’re going
too slowly towards the summit.

1062
00:56:59.618 --> 00:57:01.119 size:60%
-You sleep well, Inès?
-Yeah.

1063
00:57:02.919 --> 00:57:04.485 size:60%
I didn’t. I didn’t sleep a wink.

1064
00:57:04.585 --> 00:57:05.385 size:60%
Same here.

1065
00:57:06.652 --> 00:57:08.485 size:60%
I’ve never been in such bad
shape...

1066
00:57:08.785 --> 00:57:10.385 size:60%
-Yeah.
-when I’ve had to summit.

1067
00:57:11.618 --> 00:57:12.585 size:60%
But, uh...

1068
00:57:12.652 --> 00:57:14.518 size:60%
you have
to keep pushing forward.

1069
00:57:15.485 --> 00:57:16.752 size:60%
If you think and...

1070
00:57:17.618 --> 00:57:20.019 size:60%
and complain,
you won’t make it, so...

1071
00:57:20.785 --> 00:57:22.451 size:60%
you move forward and keep quiet.

1072
00:57:52.618 --> 00:57:54.618 size:60%
I have zero energy,
I don’t get it.

1073
00:58:18.552 --> 00:58:19.785 size:60%
We’re going to Camp 3.

1074
00:58:19.985 --> 00:58:23.585 size:60%
We’re taking a big...
a big pause, a big break.

1075
00:58:26.418 --> 00:58:28.119 size:60%
The sun’s gonna come out,
so things will change a bit.

1076
00:58:28.418 --> 00:58:29.685 size:60%
It’s always
tough at this time...

1077
00:58:30.385 --> 00:58:33.119 size:60%
when night ends... at daybreak.

1078
00:59:37.085 --> 00:59:38.351 size:60%
It’s going like shit.

1079
00:59:39.585 --> 00:59:41.418 size:60%
We’ve
already been gone for 4 hours.

1080
00:59:42.652 --> 00:59:43.819 size:60%
We’re only at Camp 3...

1081
00:59:44.119 --> 00:59:46.418 size:60%
We haven’t even done half of
what we were supposed to do.

1082
00:59:47.552 --> 00:59:49.852 size:60%
We’re sick. It’s covid.

1083
00:59:53.451 --> 00:59:54.585 size:60%
I’ve never seen
anything like that, bro.

1084
00:59:55.585 --> 00:59:57.085 size:60%
We’ve been
doing this since this morning!

1085
00:59:59.652 --> 01:00:01.518 size:60%
We didn’t do all this
for nothing, Mathis.

1086
01:00:02.952 --> 01:00:06.019 size:60%
We have to try to stay lucid.
We can’t overdo it.

1087
01:00:07.652 --> 01:00:09.418 size:60%
There are 500
fucking meters left...

1088
01:00:10.019 --> 01:00:12.385 size:60%
but they’re so steep.

1089
01:00:16.351 --> 01:00:17.119 size:60%
Why are we so worn out?

1090
01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.451 size:60%
This is a horrible feeling,
Mathis.

1091
01:00:24.119 --> 01:00:27.085 size:60%
This is so shitty.
It really sucks!

1092
01:00:30.819 --> 01:00:33.052 size:60%
I really wanted to get up there.

1093
01:00:43.685 --> 01:00:45.852 size:60%
Dude,
I can see how slow we’re walking.

1094
01:00:46.585 --> 01:00:48.119 size:60%
There’s no way we’re
going to make it up there.

1095
01:00:50.785 --> 01:00:52.585 size:60%
We don’t
have enough energy or the pace.

1096
01:00:54.752 --> 01:00:56.351 size:60%
It’s so frustrating!

1097
01:01:12.618 --> 01:01:13.485 size:60%
Dammit.

1098
01:01:29.451 --> 01:01:31.119 size:60%
Jordan to Mathis. Any news?

1099
01:01:34.652 --> 01:01:36.052 size:60%
Jordan’s asking for updates.

1100
01:01:40.752 --> 01:01:41.919 size:60%
Mathis to Jordan.

1101
01:01:42.752 --> 01:01:43.652 size:60%
We’re exhausted.

1102
01:01:44.552 --> 01:01:46.085 size:60%
We’ll probably head back down.

1103
01:01:52.752 --> 01:01:54.585 size:60%
Wait, you recorded your
father at the restaurant?

1104
01:01:54.985 --> 01:01:56.552 size:60%
Without him knowing?

1105
01:01:57.385 --> 01:01:58.985 size:60%
I thought to myself,
I have to record this.

1106
01:01:59.052 --> 01:02:00.085 size:60%
Because...

1107
01:02:00.451 --> 01:02:02.685 size:60%
if one day I’m in trouble,

1108
01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:04.485 size:60%
or lacking
motivation, I’ll listen to it.

1109
01:02:06.052 --> 01:02:07.652 size:60%
I’ll play it to myself, and...

1110
01:02:08.085 --> 01:02:09.885 size:60%
it’ll remind me what he said.

1111
01:02:12.919 --> 01:02:14.119 size:60%
-I’m your father.
-But don’t worry.

1112
01:02:14.318 --> 01:02:16.819 size:60%
You’re a man today,
you’re not a kid anymore.

1113
01:02:17.052 --> 01:02:18.451 size:60%
Stop telling me not to worry.

1114
01:02:18.952 --> 01:02:19.618 size:60%
I’ll always worry about you...

1115
01:02:19.685 --> 01:02:20.752 size:60%
All my life.
And your mother feels the same.

1116
01:02:20.885 --> 01:02:23.052 size:60%
Yeah, but I just want to
know if you trust me or not.

1117
01:02:23.418 --> 01:02:25.785 size:60%
You see who you are today
and the journey you’ve taken?

1118
01:02:25.819 --> 01:02:27.418 size:60%
Do you think I have doubts?

1119
01:02:27.518 --> 01:02:29.351 size:60%
Yeah, but when I hear
you talk like that...

1120
01:02:29.485 --> 01:02:30.985 size:60%
It’s my job to do this.

1121
01:02:31.385 --> 01:02:33.019 size:60%
You can’t
imagine what it’s like...

1122
01:02:33.518 --> 01:02:35.852 size:60%
But it’s not
a matter of being lucky or not...

1123
01:02:35.985 --> 01:02:36.785 size:60%
Well, you are!

1124
01:02:37.085 --> 01:02:38.752 size:60%
Everything you’re doing,
we’ve never done.

1125
01:02:38.819 --> 01:02:40.952 size:60%
I’m just telling you
to be very careful.

1126
01:02:41.485 --> 01:02:42.885 size:60%
I’m asking you
to trust your gut.

1127
01:02:42.952 --> 01:02:44.485 size:60%
If you think you’re safe...

1128
01:02:44.852 --> 01:02:45.752 size:60%
or if something’s not right...

1129
01:02:46.552 --> 01:02:47.618 size:60%
just follow your instincts.

1130
01:02:48.518 --> 01:02:49.451 size:60%
All right, guys.

1131
01:02:49.652 --> 01:02:50.318 size:60%
Let’s do this, dammit.

1132
01:02:50.752 --> 01:02:54.618 size:60%
We gonna do this, Mathis.

1133
01:02:55.351 --> 01:02:55.952 size:60%
Okay?

1134
01:02:59.785 --> 01:03:02.418 size:60%
Bro, I didn’t climb
2000 fucking meters...

1135
01:03:02.785 --> 01:03:03.919 size:60%
just to stop here, right?

1136
01:03:04.718 --> 01:03:05.718 size:60%
I mean it.

1137
01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:09.952 size:60%
Even if it’s
a hundred meters at a time.

1138
01:03:11.318 --> 01:03:11.752 size:60%
Inès...

1139
01:03:11.952 --> 01:03:13.451 size:60%
-Yeah? 
-can you follow me now?

1140
01:03:13.752 --> 01:03:15.052 size:60%
-Can I follow you?
-Yeah.

1141
01:03:16.318 --> 01:03:17.552 size:60%
-Slowly.
-Okay.

1142
01:03:18.451 --> 01:03:19.785 size:60%
Do you think we can do it,
Dorji?

1143
01:03:19.852 --> 01:03:20.385 size:60%
Yeah.

1144
01:03:21.019 --> 01:03:22.485 size:60%
We’re gonna do it, my friends.

1145
01:03:23.052 --> 01:03:23.985 size:60%
Hey, Mathis!

1146
01:03:24.885 --> 01:03:25.685 size:60%
We’re gonna do it, bro.

1147
01:03:27.085 --> 01:03:28.451 size:60%
We’re gonna get up and do this.

1148
01:04:01.718 --> 01:04:02.852 size:60%
I’m so proud of you.

1149
01:04:03.718 --> 01:04:05.518 size:60%
Every step that you take...

1150
01:04:05.952 --> 01:04:07.085 size:60%
we’ll be with you.

1151
01:04:13.985 --> 01:04:14.919 size:60%
Dorji...

1152
01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:16.785 size:60%
We fucking did it...

1153
01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:18.318 size:60%
I fucking did it...

1154
01:04:18.718 --> 01:04:21.385 size:60%
I did it! Holy shit, I did it!

1155
01:04:22.119 --> 01:04:23.852 size:60%
I finally did it...

1156
01:04:24.852 --> 01:04:26.618 size:60%
Holy shit!

1157
01:04:29.418 --> 01:04:31.718 size:60%
It scares me that I might
not always be able to make it!

1158
01:04:35.085 --> 01:04:36.919 size:60%
You just feel so stressed out,
you know?

1159
01:04:38.119 --> 01:04:39.418 size:60%
You’re scared, you’re...

1160
01:04:42.652 --> 01:04:45.019 size:60%
And when you get there dude,
it just so good, man!

1161
01:04:46.552 --> 01:04:49.119 size:60%
Holy shit... it’s so beautiful.

1162
01:04:58.385 --> 01:05:00.919 size:60%
Thank you, Dorji.
Thank you, my friend.

1163
01:05:01.885 --> 01:05:02.785 size:60%
You good?

1164
01:05:05.385 --> 01:05:08.052 size:60%
We did it together.
And Mathis is coming.

1165
01:05:12.418 --> 01:05:15.552 size:60%
We did it, guys! The summit!

1166
01:05:16.785 --> 01:05:17.985 size:60%
The Summit!

1167
01:05:18.852 --> 01:05:21.385 size:60%
Aw, we did it!
I’m so proud of us, we did it!

1168
01:05:21.985 --> 01:05:23.451 size:60%
We did it!! We did it!!

1169
01:05:23.785 --> 01:05:24.785 size:60%
We did good.

1170
01:05:25.585 --> 01:05:26.885 size:60%
I really
thought we wouldn’t make it.

1171
01:05:26.985 --> 01:05:28.752 size:60%
We didn’t think
we could do it...

1172
01:05:28.819 --> 01:05:29.685 size:60%
But we did.

1173
01:05:30.652 --> 01:05:32.919 size:60%
You should never give up!
We deserve this.

1174
01:05:34.351 --> 01:05:36.919 size:60%
Manish, bro! We did it, brother.

1175
01:05:39.585 --> 01:05:41.052 size:60%
We were so close to giving up.

1176
01:05:41.119 --> 01:05:42.652 size:60%
Down at Camp 3...

1177
01:05:43.685 --> 01:05:44.852 size:60%
I thought it was over.

1178
01:05:52.885 --> 01:05:55.351 size:60%
If it weren’t for him, I wouldn’t
have gotten to the summit.

1179
01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:57.052 size:60%
He pushed us all really hard.

1180
01:05:57.451 --> 01:05:58.718 size:60%
He said to himself,

1181
01:05:58.785 --> 01:06:00.418 size:60%
“No question,
I’m going up, dammit.

1182
01:06:00.652 --> 01:06:01.552 size:60%
I’ve been here for 20 days.

1183
01:06:01.618 --> 01:06:03.852 size:60%
I’m going up this mountain,
not back to Paris.”

1184
01:06:03.952 --> 01:06:05.618 size:60%
Quite frankly,
you’re making me hallucinate.

1185
01:06:05.952 --> 01:06:06.618 size:60%
Honestly...

1186
01:06:06.752 --> 01:06:08.985 size:60%
I wouldn’t have had
the mental strength to continue.

1187
01:06:09.085 --> 01:06:10.752 size:60%
This is our come-back, bro!

1188
01:06:10.819 --> 01:06:13.351 size:60%
-Are you good?
-I’m good!

1189
01:06:13.518 --> 01:06:14.552 size:60%
Everest is behind!

1190
01:06:14.618 --> 01:06:17.518 size:60%
That one is next, Mathis!
That one is next!

1191
01:06:26.451 --> 01:06:28.685 size:60%
-The summit, bro! We did it!
-We did it!

1192
01:06:30.785 --> 01:06:34.518 size:60%
-Yeah! The summit, you guys!
-The summit!

1193
01:06:34.819 --> 01:06:36.585 size:60%
And now back down, the same day.

1194
01:06:36.718 --> 01:06:38.019 size:60%
Oh damn, it’s the Swiss guy!

1195
01:06:38.085 --> 01:06:40.618 size:60%
The Swiss are here!
We weren’t going to miss that.

1196
01:06:40.852 --> 01:06:43.885 size:60%
Well done, dude.
Man, I have the craziest story.

1197
01:06:44.119 --> 01:06:45.485 size:60%
I’ve had hemorrhoids

1198
01:06:45.552 --> 01:06:46.485 size:60%
for two days and
they hurt so bad.

1199
01:06:46.985 --> 01:06:48.318 size:60%
Dude, it’s so bad!

1200
01:06:48.819 --> 01:06:51.418 size:60%
You guys, my butt,
my butt is on fire, bro!

1201
01:06:51.552 --> 01:06:52.618 size:60%
It hurts so bad!

1202
01:06:52.752 --> 01:06:54.718 size:60%
I’m in so much pain,
I don’t know what to do...

1203
01:06:54.885 --> 01:06:57.685 size:60%
I went up Ama Dablam with
hemorrhoids bro!

1204
01:06:57.952 --> 01:06:58.819 size:60%
I’m crazy, bro.

1205
01:07:00.885 --> 01:07:01.985 size:60%
Our faces look really rough.

1206
01:07:03.351 --> 01:07:04.952 size:60%
We look ugly.

1207
01:07:05.552 --> 01:07:06.885 size:60%
I don’t know how we did it.

1208
01:07:07.552 --> 01:07:09.451 size:60%
Every time we climb,
I don’t know how we did it.

1209
01:07:09.785 --> 01:07:11.485 size:60%
Uh, yeah, but you impressed me.

1210
01:07:11.819 --> 01:07:13.685 size:60%
If it were up to me, I would have
turned around, like...

1211
01:07:13.752 --> 01:07:14.418 size:60%
ten times.

1212
01:07:14.685 --> 01:07:15.885 size:60%
You know, actually...

1213
01:07:15.952 --> 01:07:17.718 size:60%
high altitudes,
high altitudes like that

1214
01:07:17.785 --> 01:07:19.085 size:60%
aren’t my specialty.
It’s not like...

1215
01:07:19.552 --> 01:07:20.819 size:60%
You know, I’m not a Sherpa...

1216
01:07:21.318 --> 01:07:23.718 size:60%
I went to the Himalayas twice
before this trip, but I’m not...

1217
01:07:23.785 --> 01:07:24.952 size:60%
It’s the altitude.

1218
01:07:25.019 --> 01:07:26.318 size:60%
You prefer technical
stuff in the Alps and stuff?

1219
01:07:26.385 --> 01:07:28.785 size:60%
That’s more my specialty.
I’m stronger in that area.

1220
01:07:29.485 --> 01:07:31.418 size:60%
That’s why I realized
that it’s all in the mind.

1221
01:07:31.585 --> 01:07:34.052 size:60%
Physically we thought that we
were dead, but then you realize,

1222
01:07:34.119 --> 01:07:36.119 size:60%
wow, we made it
another 800 meters, bro! It’s...

1223
01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:36.752 size:60%
Yeah.

1224
01:07:37.385 --> 01:07:39.119 size:60%
It’s all part
of climbing high altitudes, dude.

1225
01:07:39.752 --> 01:07:41.552 size:60%
You accept
that you’ll get hurt and suffer.

1226
01:07:41.618 --> 01:07:42.952 size:60%
Those 290 meters...

1227
01:07:43.585 --> 01:07:44.385 size:60%
they really hurt.

1228
01:07:44.418 --> 01:07:47.119 size:60%
Next up is a bigger one where
we’re going to suffer even more.

1229
01:07:48.385 --> 01:07:48.718 size:60%
Yeah.

1230
01:07:48.919 --> 01:07:50.852 size:60%
Maybe not in terms steepness,
but in terms of oxygen.

1231
01:07:50.985 --> 01:07:51.585 size:60%
Yeah!

1232
01:07:56.418 --> 01:07:57.085 size:60%
Five...

1233
01:07:59.385 --> 01:07:59.985 size:60%
Four...

1234
01:08:02.052 --> 01:08:02.785 size:60%
Three...

1235
01:08:05.351 --> 01:08:05.819 size:60%
Two...

1236
01:08:07.552 --> 01:08:08.052 size:60%
One...

1237
01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:10.518 size:60%
Hey, everyone!

1238
01:08:10.552 --> 01:08:11.585 size:60%
Hey, you guys! Hey, you guys!

1239
01:08:11.585 --> 01:08:13.418 size:60%
Hey, you guys!
So today, there’s a new video!

1240
01:08:13.485 --> 01:08:14.885 size:60%
A new video... A new video...

1241
01:08:14.952 --> 01:08:17.019 size:60%
After a
month away from YouTube...

1242
01:08:17.718 --> 01:08:19.451 size:60%
I desperately need to catch up.

1243
01:08:19.552 --> 01:08:20.652 size:60%
-Hello!
-How are you?

1244
01:08:20.852 --> 01:08:22.418 size:60%
Inoxtag is here with us!

1245
01:08:23.985 --> 01:08:24.919 size:60%
Let’s go!

1246
01:08:25.985 --> 01:08:27.552 size:60%
Who will be the last survivor?

1247
01:08:27.618 --> 01:08:27.985 size:60%
Hurry!

1248
01:08:28.552 --> 01:08:30.418 size:60%
You’re
controlling 4 vehicles each.

1249
01:08:31.518 --> 01:08:33.752 size:60%
We’re in the backrooms,
and the aim is to escape!

1250
01:08:34.585 --> 01:08:35.752 size:60%
We’ll continue
with Michou’s live.

1251
01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:37.119 size:60%
Inox is on the stream!

1252
01:08:39.752 --> 01:08:41.451 size:60%
-How are you doing, Inox?
-I’m doing awesome!

1253
01:08:41.552 --> 01:08:42.451 size:60%
It’s after 2 am...

1254
01:08:42.552 --> 01:08:44.585 size:60%
And tomorrow, I film at 9am.

1255
01:08:46.885 --> 01:08:48.952 size:60%
It's here!

1256
01:08:54.752 --> 01:08:55.852 size:60%
You know, I have a confession.

1257
01:08:55.885 --> 01:08:57.052 size:60%
Inès isn’t here, but...

1258
01:08:57.418 --> 01:08:58.819 size:60%
I think he’s doing too much.

1259
01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:00.585 size:60%
I’m feeling like a worried dad!

1260
01:09:01.652 --> 01:09:02.552 size:60%
All those livestreams...

1261
01:09:02.852 --> 01:09:04.451 size:60%
-I’m afraid for him!
-I agree with you.

1262
01:09:04.518 --> 01:09:05.952 size:60%
When Inès
got back from Ama Dablam,

1263
01:09:06.085 --> 01:09:07.952 size:60%
he was totally burned out,
totally exhausted.

1264
01:09:08.518 --> 01:09:10.052 size:60%
His nerves are fried,
and he’s fatigued.

1265
01:09:10.119 --> 01:09:12.952 size:60%
His head and his body are messed
up. He’s also lost 8 kilos.

1266
01:09:13.385 --> 01:09:14.819 size:60%
I’ve lost all of my muscles.

1267
01:09:17.351 --> 01:09:18.852 size:60%
Dude, I’m all skinny.

1268
01:09:19.019 --> 01:09:21.119 size:60%
You know, if I shave,
I’ll look like “Inès 2013.”

1269
01:09:21.418 --> 01:09:22.819 size:60%
First of all, what he needs

1270
01:09:22.885 --> 01:09:24.785 size:60%
is to get back in good shape,
physically.

1271
01:09:24.852 --> 01:09:25.552 size:60%
Is everyone here?

1272
01:09:25.618 --> 01:09:26.785 size:60%
For me, it’s Subway Surfer.

1273
01:09:27.019 --> 01:09:28.785 size:60%
-I’m trying to hold on.
-Inox.

1274
01:09:29.351 --> 01:09:30.385 size:60%
You have to come with me.

1275
01:09:30.819 --> 01:09:33.819 size:60%
I’m tired so exhausted, bro!
I’m tired!

1276
01:09:34.119 --> 01:09:36.819 size:60%
Guys, I’m really dead, I’m not
going to last, there’s no way.

1277
01:09:36.919 --> 01:09:39.618 size:60%
As soon as you finish something,
bam! You’re onto the next one!

1278
01:09:39.718 --> 01:09:40.418 size:60%
It sucks, bro.

1279
01:09:40.485 --> 01:09:42.618 size:60%
There’s no way I can last
another 30 minutes on a live.

1280
01:09:42.652 --> 01:09:43.919 size:60%
I’m too tired, bro.

1281
01:09:47.585 --> 01:09:48.618 size:60%
I’m burned out! You know?

1282
01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:51.052 size:60%
I’m just so overwhelmed.
I’m so overwhelmed.

1283
01:09:51.418 --> 01:09:52.752 size:60%
I said yes to too many things!

1284
01:09:53.685 --> 01:09:54.985 size:60%
And now I’m committed to them.

1285
01:09:55.351 --> 01:09:56.952 size:60%
We can adjust the ideas,
and the model,

1286
01:09:57.019 --> 01:09:58.585 size:60%
and the operation,
but only you...

1287
01:09:58.919 --> 01:10:00.585 size:60%
can make the final call,
you know?

1288
01:10:00.785 --> 01:10:01.652 size:60%
It’s just that...

1289
01:10:02.052 --> 01:10:04.785 size:60%
you know, I, I look like a
spoiled brat, and I hate that.

1290
01:10:05.318 --> 01:10:05.718 size:60%
Yeah, but still...

1291
01:10:05.852 --> 01:10:07.985 size:60%
I mean, look, I’m making
a cool video, you know?

1292
01:10:08.052 --> 01:10:10.652 size:60%
And... yet, I think,
damn I have too much to do.

1293
01:10:11.085 --> 01:10:12.485 size:60%
Okay, but you have the right to

1294
01:10:12.552 --> 01:10:13.351 size:60%
not be
happy about what you’re doing.

1295
01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:15.351 size:60%
Yeah, but there are
people out there who, uh...

1296
01:10:15.518 --> 01:10:16.652 size:60%
break their balls getting up at 6

1297
01:10:16.718 --> 01:10:18.585 size:60%
and going to bed at 8,
and I’m here...

1298
01:10:18.718 --> 01:10:19.418 size:60%
just here...

1299
01:10:19.485 --> 01:10:20.652 size:60%
complaining because I have a live

1300
01:10:20.718 --> 01:10:22.451 size:60%
during the
night and a shoot during the day!

1301
01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:24.451 size:60%
I’m acting spoiled, dude.

1302
01:10:24.718 --> 01:10:26.552 size:60%
You’re telling yourself
that because you, uh...

1303
01:10:27.485 --> 01:10:28.652 size:60%
You know, I think I’m scared...

1304
01:10:29.919 --> 01:10:31.885 size:60%
of becoming a slacker, I guess.

1305
01:10:32.052 --> 01:10:33.585 size:60%
Because right now,
I’m doing things that are more...

1306
01:10:33.618 --> 01:10:35.119 size:60%
more thrilling than I’ve ever
done before, and yet look at me!

1307
01:10:35.685 --> 01:10:37.318 size:60%
A video where
I’m in my car around the clock?

1308
01:10:37.785 --> 01:10:38.718 size:60%
I used to have fun!

1309
01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:41.485 size:60%
But enough is enough,
I’ve been there done that, uh...

1310
01:10:41.952 --> 01:10:43.919 size:60%
I just want
to think about Everest!

1311
01:10:46.119 --> 01:10:47.852 size:60%
If this experience...

1312
01:10:48.052 --> 01:10:49.052 size:60%
hadn’t changed me...

1313
01:10:49.819 --> 01:10:50.518 size:60%
mentally...

1314
01:10:52.885 --> 01:10:54.718 size:60%
I would have reached the top,

1315
01:10:54.785 --> 01:10:55.885 size:60%
and like the other projects,
I would’ve said

1316
01:10:55.952 --> 01:10:56.985 size:60%
“Okay, I made it, now what?”

1317
01:10:58.552 --> 01:10:59.819 size:60%
It’s the worst failure.

1318
01:11:00.351 --> 01:11:01.752 size:60%
For sure, I’m a new man.

1319
01:11:01.819 --> 01:11:03.318 size:60%
You can compare, uh...

1320
01:11:03.585 --> 01:11:05.085 size:60%
the Inès from the beginning...

1321
01:11:05.585 --> 01:11:06.752 size:60%
when the project was announced...

1322
01:11:07.385 --> 01:11:09.119 size:60%
to the one at the end,
and they’re two different guys.

1323
01:11:10.418 --> 01:11:11.852 size:60%
Whether it’s because of
me or because of others...

1324
01:11:12.451 --> 01:11:14.952 size:60%
If I don’t change, it’ll just be
one more project to add to...

1325
01:11:15.019 --> 01:11:17.119 size:60%
the catalog,
and what’s the real takeaway?

1326
01:11:22.119 --> 01:11:24.618 size:60%
At the moment, he’s doing
too much at the same time.

1327
01:11:24.785 --> 01:11:27.085 size:60%
Between his life as a
YouTuber and as an athlete...

1328
01:11:27.351 --> 01:11:29.585 size:60%
It was making me dizzy!
So, I called him, and I said...

1329
01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:30.819 size:60%
“You have to make a choice.

1330
01:11:30.885 --> 01:11:33.085 size:60%
You can’t do
everything at the same intensity

1331
01:11:33.119 --> 01:11:34.085 size:60%
all at once and
hope to have it all.

1332
01:11:34.552 --> 01:11:36.618 size:60%
Either you focus
on yourself and your preparation,

1333
01:11:36.685 --> 01:11:37.919 size:60%
or you focus on your projects.”

1334
01:11:41.085 --> 01:11:43.052 size:60%
I’m sending a voice
message just to make it quick.

1335
01:11:43.552 --> 01:11:45.552 size:60%
I don’t know what’s going on,
but...

1336
01:11:46.119 --> 01:11:47.685 size:60%
it’s really starting
to get out of hand.

1337
01:11:48.052 --> 01:11:49.485 size:60%
This isn’t the time to be stupid.

1338
01:11:49.552 --> 01:11:51.985 size:60%
You’re sabotaging all the
hard work we’ve done this year.

1339
01:12:03.351 --> 01:12:04.585 size:60%
It’s time for you to refocus.

1340
01:12:04.985 --> 01:12:07.119 size:60%
To put everything into
this project and do it right.

1341
01:12:08.351 --> 01:12:10.052 size:60%
Even if it’s hard,
or you’re having problems

1342
01:12:10.119 --> 01:12:11.685 size:60%
with I don’t know what,
it’s no excuse.

1343
01:12:23.985 --> 01:12:25.718 size:60%
So, what I’m asking you to do...

1344
01:12:26.085 --> 01:12:28.485 size:60%
is to eliminate
everything except your workouts.

1345
01:12:28.552 --> 01:12:30.318 size:60%
That’s your only priority,
your workouts.

1346
01:12:30.385 --> 01:12:31.919 size:60%
That’s your job right now.

1347
01:12:32.385 --> 01:12:33.485 size:60%
It’s time to wake up.

1348
01:14:00.652 --> 01:14:01.585 size:60%
It’s not possible.

1349
01:14:01.652 --> 01:14:03.985 size:60%
It hasn’t been a year already,
time hasn’t gone by that fast.

1350
01:14:04.585 --> 01:14:07.418 size:60%
The 6 months between
Ama Dablam and this moment...

1351
01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:08.685 size:60%
it couldn’t have
gone by that fast!

1352
01:14:09.985 --> 01:14:10.652 size:60%
Here we go, guys.

1353
01:14:11.652 --> 01:14:12.652 size:60%
You know, time is so insane!

1354
01:14:13.652 --> 01:14:14.952 size:60%
-One year.
-One year.

1355
01:14:15.085 --> 01:14:16.752 size:60%
Climbing Everest
is already tough...

1356
01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:18.985 size:60%
but the
challenge had to be even tougher!

1357
01:14:19.451 --> 01:14:21.451 size:60%
Instead of taking my phone,
I’ll leave it at the studio.

1358
01:14:21.618 --> 01:14:22.852 size:60%
No one in the studio believes me.

1359
01:14:23.052 --> 01:14:24.819 size:60%
-You’re really leaving it?
-Look, my cell phone...

1360
01:14:25.019 --> 01:14:25.785 size:60%
I’m leaving it.

1361
01:14:25.919 --> 01:14:26.752 size:60%
You’re not taking a phone?

1362
01:14:26.885 --> 01:14:29.585 size:60%
I’m not taking it. It’s okay!
Total disconnection.

1363
01:14:29.785 --> 01:14:31.052 size:60%
I’ll focus on the objective!

1364
01:14:31.119 --> 01:14:32.552 size:60%
Take it and turn it off.

1365
01:14:32.652 --> 01:14:35.019 size:60%
No! Stop telling me to take it!
I’m leaving it!

1366
01:14:35.418 --> 01:14:37.785 size:60%
Mathis didn’t believe me,
he said I wouldn’t do it...

1367
01:14:37.852 --> 01:14:39.418 size:60%
and that it’s just
for the cameras...

1368
01:14:39.552 --> 01:14:40.919 size:60%
I don’t have my
phone and it’s weird!

1369
01:14:40.985 --> 01:14:42.451 size:60%
I just tried
to take it out of my pocket.

1370
01:14:42.785 --> 01:14:45.418 size:60%
I already reached for it!
But there was only my passport!

1371
01:14:45.618 --> 01:14:46.785 size:60%
Well, say bye to the studio!

1372
01:14:47.652 --> 01:14:48.485 size:60%
The time has come.

1373
01:14:48.852 --> 01:14:50.652 size:60%
Man, it’s so crazy! One year.

1374
01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:51.518 size:60%
It’s the big day.

1375
01:14:53.019 --> 01:14:53.885 size:60%
Bro, here we go!

1376
01:14:54.451 --> 01:14:57.085 size:60%
And so, we’re off for a
ten-day trek to acclimatize.

1377
01:15:26.819 --> 01:15:27.685 size:60%
I’m not feeling great.

1378
01:15:28.518 --> 01:15:29.685 size:60%
Dammit, I’m getting sick again...

1379
01:15:29.885 --> 01:15:31.451 size:60%
But it’s normal,
it’s the altitude.

1380
01:15:31.618 --> 01:15:32.685 size:60%
We’re getting acclimated,
so it’ll pass.

1381
01:15:34.385 --> 01:15:36.318 size:60%
I know my body.
Just give me...

1382
01:15:36.385 --> 01:15:37.019 size:60%
24 hours.

1383
01:15:39.451 --> 01:15:41.085 size:60%
I could have all the diseases in
the world...

1384
01:15:41.451 --> 01:15:42.351 size:60%
and I’d still go up.

1385
01:15:54.618 --> 01:15:55.518 size:60%
Mathis!

1386
01:15:55.852 --> 01:15:56.618 size:60%
Yeah, bro?

1387
01:15:56.752 --> 01:15:58.451 size:60%
Base camp’s in sight!

1388
01:16:03.652 --> 01:16:04.485 size:60%
It’s like a city!

1389
01:16:04.785 --> 01:16:06.052 size:60%
Yeah, I guess. It’s not bad...

1390
01:16:06.119 --> 01:16:07.385 size:60%
it’s not that big.

1391
01:16:07.585 --> 01:16:08.652 size:60%
I think it’s huge!

1392
01:16:09.585 --> 01:16:11.085 size:60%
-Base camp.
-Base camp, yep.

1393
01:16:11.718 --> 01:16:13.585 size:60%
I promised,
I said no matter what...

1394
01:16:13.718 --> 01:16:15.718 size:60%
I’ll see you
in 2024 at the foot of Everest.

1395
01:16:15.952 --> 01:16:17.819 size:60%
Promise kept.
You did it, it’s awesome.

1396
01:16:19.852 --> 01:16:22.618 size:60%
-You never gave up. One year.
-One year, we never gave up.

1397
01:16:22.852 --> 01:16:24.919 size:60%
One year, dude.
You never gave up no matter what.

1398
01:16:27.819 --> 01:16:28.618 size:60%
Do you regret it?

1399
01:16:28.718 --> 01:16:30.718 size:60%
Not for a second.
It’s the best decision ever.

1400
01:16:31.318 --> 01:16:33.418 size:60%
Dude, I feel so good, I’m happy.

1401
01:16:36.885 --> 01:16:38.652 size:60%
Thanks for coming with me,
Mathis.

1402
01:16:39.318 --> 01:16:41.952 size:60%
You’re welcome, bro.
It was a pleasure. We go this.

1403
01:16:49.119 --> 01:16:51.052 size:60%
Dude! Our camp is awesome!

1404
01:16:51.485 --> 01:16:53.085 size:60%
I’m so happy!
We’re finally here!

1405
01:16:56.019 --> 01:16:58.652 size:60%
Ila Nuru!
Sunglasses on the summit, bro!

1406
01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:05.585 size:60%
-Hey, Manish! Ah! Are you good?!
-I’m good!

1407
01:17:11.418 --> 01:17:12.485 size:60%
Come on, bro!

1408
01:17:18.451 --> 01:17:19.685 size:60%
Good job!

1409
01:17:21.052 --> 01:17:22.585 size:60%
We’re not acclimatized just yet.

1410
01:17:22.718 --> 01:17:23.585 size:60%
-Manish?
-Yo.

1411
01:17:23.618 --> 01:17:24.785 size:60%
Are you a fan of basketball?

1412
01:17:24.885 --> 01:17:28.885 size:60%
Yeah! I’m, I’m a huge fan,
and I, I used to play a lot.

1413
01:17:28.985 --> 01:17:29.919 size:60%
Were you on a team?

1414
01:17:29.985 --> 01:17:32.819 size:60%
Yeah... I represented Nepal
in 2011...

1415
01:17:33.019 --> 01:17:34.518 size:60%
in Rimini, Italy.

1416
01:17:34.552 --> 01:17:36.318 size:60%
-Dude, he’s an ex-pro.
-He’s the real deal.

1417
01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:37.985 size:60%
Yeah,
it’s a tribute to Kobe Bryant.

1418
01:17:38.085 --> 01:17:40.618 size:60%
For the summit,
he drew Kobe Bryant on his boots.

1419
01:17:40.718 --> 01:17:41.518 size:60%
The guy is ready to go.

1420
01:17:41.585 --> 01:17:42.518 size:60%
Let’s do it for Kobe.

1421
01:17:42.585 --> 01:17:44.718 size:60%
I have a surprise for him, but he
doesn’t know yet.

1422
01:17:44.852 --> 01:17:45.718 size:60%
It’s a surprise.

1423
01:17:45.752 --> 01:17:48.451 size:60%
Manish...
what’s your life’s dream, bro?

1424
01:17:48.718 --> 01:17:50.952 size:60%
Right now,
the dream is to be at the top...

1425
01:17:52.119 --> 01:17:54.518 size:60%
of Sagarmatha, of Everest.

1426
01:17:54.819 --> 01:17:58.451 size:60%
-We have the same dream, brother.
-Yeah.Let’s do it.

1427
01:17:58.718 --> 01:17:59.819 size:60%
I made a promise to Manish,

1428
01:17:59.885 --> 01:18:02.085 size:60%
because he wanted to summit
Everest last year but couldn’t.

1429
01:18:02.385 --> 01:18:03.885 size:60%
He had to stop at Camp 4,

1430
01:18:03.952 --> 01:18:05.785 size:60%
because his
client didn’t have enough oxygen

1431
01:18:05.852 --> 01:18:07.618 size:60%
for him to climb
up to the summit.

1432
01:18:07.685 --> 01:18:09.885 size:60%
He told him, “Stay at Camp 4,
you can’t summit.”

1433
01:18:10.585 --> 01:18:12.418 size:60%
I promised him
that he will climb up with us.

1434
01:18:12.485 --> 01:18:14.418 size:60%
The whole team will...
They’ll all climb with us.

1435
01:18:14.552 --> 01:18:15.052 size:60%
Let’s go!

1436
01:18:15.085 --> 01:18:17.119 size:60%
There will be enough
for everyone to summit.

1437
01:18:19.819 --> 01:18:22.485 size:60%
We have Sunam here. He’ll be
coming on the expedition with us.

1438
01:18:22.585 --> 01:18:25.552 size:60%
You’re from Longtang Valley?
The earthquake was in 2015?

1439
01:18:30.552 --> 01:18:31.485 size:60%
His whole village...

1440
01:18:31.885 --> 01:18:33.852 size:60%
his house totally
collapsed, everything collapsed.

1441
01:18:33.919 --> 01:18:35.019 size:60%
Your whole house?

1442
01:18:36.919 --> 01:18:38.552 size:60%
He stopped
working for a while to...

1443
01:18:38.718 --> 01:18:40.451 size:60%
help his family and...

1444
01:18:40.618 --> 01:18:41.752 size:60%
to rebuild their house.

1445
01:18:41.985 --> 01:18:43.685 size:60%
When I was taking the guide exam,

1446
01:18:43.819 --> 01:18:45.385 size:60%
we did an exchange
with some Nepalese...

1447
01:18:45.819 --> 01:18:46.819 size:60%
He was gonna go.

1448
01:18:46.885 --> 01:18:48.351 size:60%
and Sunam
was supposed to come with us,

1449
01:18:48.418 --> 01:18:50.351 size:60%
but he couldn’t because
he had to help his family

1450
01:18:50.418 --> 01:18:52.351 size:60%
rebuild their house and village.

1451
01:18:52.451 --> 01:18:53.451 size:60%
Damn, man.

1452
01:18:54.852 --> 01:18:55.852 size:60%
It was important
to build the house

1453
01:18:55.919 --> 01:18:57.652 size:60%
and keep my family safe.

1454
01:18:57.852 --> 01:19:00.785 size:60%
And after,
I can do the courses.

1455
01:19:01.985 --> 01:19:03.752 size:60%
We’re
happy to work with the team...

1456
01:19:04.085 --> 01:19:05.485 size:60%
because you guys are...

1457
01:19:05.685 --> 01:19:07.819 size:60%
a lot better than
normal novice clients.

1458
01:19:08.385 --> 01:19:10.885 size:60%
There are some clients who don’t
even know how to put on crampons.

1459
01:19:11.418 --> 01:19:11.985 size:60%
Damn.

1460
01:19:12.351 --> 01:19:14.085 size:60%
There’s was even somebody

1461
01:19:14.351 --> 01:19:16.518 size:60%
where we
had to put his boots on as well!

1462
01:19:16.618 --> 01:19:19.351 size:60%
-What? I don’t believe you.
-It’s true! Right, Manish?

1463
01:19:19.451 --> 01:19:21.085 size:60%
And sometimes, like,
a guy needs to pee,

1464
01:19:21.119 --> 01:19:23.451 size:60%
and he says, “Oh,
my hands are so numb!

1465
01:19:23.518 --> 01:19:25.385 size:60%
I can’t even pee.”
And we have to go and open...

1466
01:19:25.418 --> 01:19:26.618 size:60%
No! No, I don’t buy it!

1467
01:19:26.685 --> 01:19:27.585 size:60%
I don’t buy it...

1468
01:19:28.585 --> 01:19:29.985 size:60%
-No way, really?
-It’s true.

1469
01:19:30.518 --> 01:19:32.085 size:60%
The client was an old man,
so we said...

1470
01:19:32.585 --> 01:19:33.919 size:60%
okay, okay. Come on.

1471
01:19:33.985 --> 01:19:35.085 size:60%
He had to hold his penis

1472
01:19:35.718 --> 01:19:36.785 size:60%
so he could pee.

1473
01:19:36.852 --> 01:19:38.085 size:60%
Bro, that’s so disgusting.

1474
01:19:39.085 --> 01:19:41.652 size:60%
So, I guess...
we’re considered a level up.

1475
01:19:43.652 --> 01:19:44.718 size:60%
Tendi!

1476
01:19:45.351 --> 01:19:46.119 size:60%
Pathan!

1477
01:19:46.718 --> 01:19:47.652 size:60%
Milan!

1478
01:19:47.819 --> 01:19:48.952 size:60%
Sama!

1479
01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:50.985 size:60%
On an expedition like this,

1480
01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:52.119 size:60%
we can’t carry
everything ourselves.

1481
01:19:52.351 --> 01:19:54.518 size:60%
So, these Nepalese porters
helped us to the base camp.

1482
01:19:55.518 --> 01:19:56.885 size:60%
And then, they come back down,
they’re done.

1483
01:19:57.451 --> 01:19:58.385 size:60%
So, uh...

1484
01:19:58.451 --> 01:19:59.451 size:60%
if we reach the summit,

1485
01:19:59.518 --> 01:20:00.752 size:60%
it’s partly
thanks to them because they’re...

1486
01:20:01.019 --> 01:20:01.785 size:60%
they’re machines.

1487
01:20:02.085 --> 01:20:03.119 size:60%
You are the best, bro!

1488
01:20:03.752 --> 01:20:04.785 size:60%
In the comments...

1489
01:20:05.385 --> 01:20:06.318 size:60%
Power to them, brothers!

1490
01:20:06.518 --> 01:20:07.952 size:60%
They’re
the real Gs of the Himalayas!

1491
01:20:11.819 --> 01:20:13.351 size:60%
Heads up!

1492
01:20:25.752 --> 01:20:28.518 size:60%
Do you think
we’ll reach the top of Everest?

1493
01:20:28.752 --> 01:20:29.052 size:60%
No.

1494
01:20:36.518 --> 01:20:38.985 size:60%
Whoa, Inès! He’s just a
little kid. We’re gonna...

1495
01:20:39.485 --> 01:20:40.552 size:60%
we’re gonna do this.

1496
01:20:43.952 --> 01:20:45.019 size:60%
It looks impossible.

1497
01:20:47.518 --> 01:20:49.019 size:60%
It’s not possible
to climb up there.

1498
01:20:49.585 --> 01:20:50.652 size:60%
It’s too big!

1499
01:20:55.418 --> 01:20:56.119 size:60%
Climbing Everest

1500
01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:58.785 size:60%
is a whole other level compared
to what I’ve done so far.

1501
01:20:59.119 --> 01:21:00.518 size:60%
We’ll have to go
through four camps...

1502
01:21:00.585 --> 01:21:02.385 size:60%
with big
challenges at each stage.

1503
01:21:02.785 --> 01:21:04.119 size:60%
We’ll start with the Icefall,

1504
01:21:04.351 --> 01:21:06.119 size:60%
one of the most
dangerous passages of the climb.

1505
01:21:06.518 --> 01:21:08.885 size:60%
We’re crossing a glacier
with crevasses and huge seracs

1506
01:21:08.952 --> 01:21:09.985 size:60%
that can give way at any moment.

1507
01:21:10.652 --> 01:21:11.518 size:60%
After Camp 1,

1508
01:21:11.685 --> 01:21:14.518 size:60%
we’ll go around huge crevasses
and cross the Western Cwm...

1509
01:21:15.019 --> 01:21:16.451 size:60%
a valley exposed to the sun where

1510
01:21:16.518 --> 01:21:18.119 size:60%
temperatures can
rise dangerously.

1511
01:21:18.885 --> 01:21:19.885 size:60%
After Camp 2,

1512
01:21:19.952 --> 01:21:21.585 size:60%
we’ll have to face the steep

1513
01:21:21.652 --> 01:21:23.085 size:60%
slope of
Lhotse to reach Camp 3...

1514
01:21:23.119 --> 01:21:24.351 size:60%
and then Camp 4.

1515
01:21:25.785 --> 01:21:28.085 size:60%
That will be when we
enter the death zone.

1516
01:21:28.885 --> 01:21:29.985 size:60%
Beyond that attitude,

1517
01:21:30.052 --> 01:21:31.119 size:60%
we’ll start to die.

1518
01:21:33.985 --> 01:21:34.985 size:60%
It’s in these extreme conditions

1519
01:21:35.052 --> 01:21:37.952 size:60%
that we must attempt the
final ascent to Everest’s summit.

1520
01:21:38.385 --> 01:21:41.752 size:60%
On a dizzying ridge with
miles of emptiness on each side.

1521
01:21:47.785 --> 01:21:49.652 size:60%
Prepare your mind for...
Everest.

1522
01:21:49.919 --> 01:21:51.752 size:60%
I don’t have that thing where
I tell myself I’m confident.

1523
01:21:53.385 --> 01:21:54.718 size:60%
I don’t have that thing where...

1524
01:21:55.119 --> 01:21:56.019 size:60%
Well... you have to...

1525
01:21:56.451 --> 01:21:57.685 size:60%
have confidence, and...

1526
01:21:57.852 --> 01:21:59.952 size:60%
continue to focus on the prep
and all that.

1527
01:22:01.552 --> 01:22:02.351 size:60%
It’ll all work out.

1528
01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:04.618 size:60%
Louis...

1529
01:22:04.852 --> 01:22:06.052 size:60%
will be filming with Manish.

1530
01:22:06.418 --> 01:22:07.919 size:60%
He did Everest last year...

1531
01:22:08.552 --> 01:22:10.119 size:60%
therefore,
his advice is precious to us.

1532
01:22:10.919 --> 01:22:12.685 size:60%
How long
from South Col to the summit?

1533
01:22:12.852 --> 01:22:13.752 size:60%
About 10 hours.

1534
01:22:14.819 --> 01:22:17.351 size:60%
-That’s a lot. I mean...
-For real, that’s a lot.

1535
01:22:17.752 --> 01:22:19.385 size:60%
It’s up the Matterhorn and back.

1536
01:22:19.718 --> 01:22:20.885 size:60%
Camp 4 to the summit...

1537
01:22:21.418 --> 01:22:22.119 size:60%
is just as far.

1538
01:22:28.418 --> 01:22:29.752 size:60%
We’ll stay
at the base camp for a month...

1539
01:22:29.952 --> 01:22:30.852 size:60%
so we can acclimatize.

1540
01:22:31.385 --> 01:22:32.885 size:60%
And then,
we’ll wait for the right moment

1541
01:22:32.952 --> 01:22:34.318 size:60%
when the weather is
good so we can climb.

1542
01:22:34.385 --> 01:22:37.418 size:60%
It only happens once a year,
so we can’t afford to miss it.

1543
01:22:40.052 --> 01:22:40.718 size:60%
Well...

1544
01:22:40.785 --> 01:22:42.819 size:60%
I’ll show you where
we’re going live for a month.

1545
01:22:42.985 --> 01:22:43.985 size:60%
Welcome to base camp!

1546
01:22:46.852 --> 01:22:48.119 size:60%
It’s a mini city,

1547
01:22:48.351 --> 01:22:50.518 size:60%
just below Everest,
at 5200 meters,

1548
01:22:50.585 --> 01:22:52.885 size:60%
and it’s really grown
over the last 50 years.

1549
01:22:53.052 --> 01:22:55.351 size:60%
There are a lot of problems, like
with pollution,

1550
01:22:55.518 --> 01:22:56.885 size:60%
and overpopulation...

1551
01:22:57.752 --> 01:22:59.418 size:60%
For now,
the base camp seems clean.

1552
01:22:59.618 --> 01:23:00.618 size:60%
But I think that up there...

1553
01:23:01.052 --> 01:23:02.985 size:60%
It’ll be worse,
and we’re going to go through it.

1554
01:23:03.418 --> 01:23:05.618 size:60%
But as Mathis taught me,
you have to leave the mountain

1555
01:23:05.685 --> 01:23:06.852 size:60%
as it was before you arrived.

1556
01:23:07.019 --> 01:23:08.418 size:60%
So, we’ll bring our
waste back down...

1557
01:23:08.752 --> 01:23:10.052 size:60%
so we don’t leave
anything on the mountain.

1558
01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:11.919 size:60%
And in the meantime...

1559
01:23:12.385 --> 01:23:13.119 size:60%
we’ll wait at our camp.

1560
01:23:15.485 --> 01:23:15.985 size:60%
Welcome to my home!

1561
01:23:16.052 --> 01:23:16.985 size:60%
Welcome to my home!

1562
01:23:17.119 --> 01:23:19.385 size:60%
Welcome to my home!
Home, home, home!

1563
01:23:19.919 --> 01:23:22.385 size:60%
Well, this is my room
here at the base camp!

1564
01:23:22.485 --> 01:23:23.985 size:60%
This is where I sleep every night

1565
01:23:24.052 --> 01:23:25.952 size:60%
with a beautiful
duvet in minus 40,

1566
01:23:26.019 --> 01:23:28.518 size:60%
and I have a duvet in it
to stay nice and warm.

1567
01:23:28.685 --> 01:23:30.718 size:60%
-Wait, let me clean this up.
-No wait, that’s pee.

1568
01:23:31.652 --> 01:23:32.418 size:60%
That’s disgusting!

1569
01:23:33.585 --> 01:23:34.585 size:60%
It’s my pee.

1570
01:23:34.985 --> 01:23:36.985 size:60%
I managed
to do a liter in one night!

1571
01:23:37.119 --> 01:23:38.618 size:60%
That’s my record
since getting here.

1572
01:23:38.685 --> 01:23:39.985 size:60%
At night when you get up to pee,

1573
01:23:40.052 --> 01:23:41.518 size:60%
because you have
to stay hydrated...

1574
01:23:41.919 --> 01:23:44.451 size:60%
you can’t be bothered to
go outside, it’s way too cold...

1575
01:23:44.585 --> 01:23:46.852 size:60%
so you grab a bottle,
and And done!

1576
01:23:46.919 --> 01:23:48.451 size:60%
You know what I mean?

1577
01:23:48.819 --> 01:23:50.385 size:60%
I have to empty
it. So, you touched my pee, man.

1578
01:23:50.518 --> 01:23:51.385 size:60%
That’s disgusting.

1579
01:23:51.685 --> 01:23:53.085 size:60%
My Air Up
is always ready to drink,

1580
01:23:53.119 --> 01:23:54.119 size:60%
you have
to hydrate at high altitudes.

1581
01:23:54.351 --> 01:23:56.085 size:60%
So here, I have my toiletry bag,

1582
01:23:56.119 --> 01:23:57.952 size:60%
this my mouthwash and my
toothbrush,

1583
01:23:58.019 --> 01:23:59.351 size:60%
and my skincare routine.

1584
01:23:59.418 --> 01:24:00.085 size:60%
I didn’t do that in Paris.

1585
01:24:00.119 --> 01:24:01.585 size:60%
I put on this moisturizing
cream from Herborian,

1586
01:24:01.652 --> 01:24:02.885 size:60%
because the sun
here is really strong.

1587
01:24:02.952 --> 01:24:04.485 size:60%
If you put this on your face...

1588
01:24:04.552 --> 01:24:05.785 size:60%
you’ll do to the summit.

1589
01:24:06.451 --> 01:24:06.785 size:60%
Sure!

1590
01:24:06.985 --> 01:24:08.085 size:60%
Summit...

1591
01:24:08.952 --> 01:24:10.618 size:60%
Summit! Nice!

1592
01:24:10.752 --> 01:24:12.685 size:60%
Nice!

1593
01:24:12.885 --> 01:24:15.019 size:60%
Well, you must be wondering
how I go to the toilet...

1594
01:24:15.652 --> 01:24:17.418 size:60%
because at night,
I pee in my bottle...

1595
01:24:17.485 --> 01:24:17.952 size:60%
but...

1596
01:24:18.119 --> 01:24:19.085 size:60%
what about daytime?

1597
01:24:19.618 --> 01:24:22.385 size:60%
Anyone there?
This is the throne! You poop...

1598
01:24:22.585 --> 01:24:23.819 size:60%
it falls into a blue canister...

1599
01:24:23.885 --> 01:24:26.119 size:60%
and as soon as it’s full,
they close it up,

1600
01:24:26.351 --> 01:24:28.685 size:60%
and they take it to the valley,
and they put the poop...

1601
01:24:28.885 --> 01:24:29.785 size:60%
at the base of the mountain.

1602
01:24:29.919 --> 01:24:30.752 size:60%
Hey Mathis!

1603
01:24:30.919 --> 01:24:33.885 size:60%
Ah! Jeez, dude!
I’m trying to tidy up a bit...

1604
01:24:34.451 --> 01:24:35.985 size:60%
-because it’s kind of a mess.
-Oh yeah. Good luck, bro!

1605
01:24:36.752 --> 01:24:38.685 size:60%
I’m out of breath now.

1606
01:24:39.685 --> 01:24:40.785 size:60%
Bro! I’m out of breath.

1607
01:24:40.852 --> 01:24:41.885 size:60%
He should have
been training too.

1608
01:24:41.952 --> 01:24:44.351 size:60%
Goddamn! He’s
the director of the documentary.

1609
01:24:44.418 --> 01:24:45.019 size:60%
Without any training...

1610
01:24:45.085 --> 01:24:46.585 size:60%
he came to the base camp to film.

1611
01:24:46.785 --> 01:24:48.852 size:60%
Hey, look who’s there.
Look who’s here.

1612
01:24:49.652 --> 01:24:50.718 size:60%
Oh my god!

1613
01:24:50.785 --> 01:24:53.685 size:60%
Oh, his feet! His feet! Oh,
my god!

1614
01:24:53.752 --> 01:24:55.518 size:60%
What is this music, bro?

1615
01:25:12.119 --> 01:25:14.019 size:60%
Manish, I’m not acclimatized yet.

1616
01:25:14.819 --> 01:25:16.952 size:60%
I have no more energy,
and speaking of energy,

1617
01:25:17.085 --> 01:25:18.119 size:60%
over there is the kitchen.

1618
01:25:18.418 --> 01:25:19.718 size:60%
The cook has been
treating us for a few days,

1619
01:25:19.785 --> 01:25:21.085 size:60%
so it’s our turn to treat him!

1620
01:25:21.385 --> 01:25:22.985 size:60%
French cheese!
You want to try it?

1621
01:25:23.019 --> 01:25:23.652 size:60%
Okay!

1622
01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:24.785 size:60%
-Okay, let’s go!
-Yeah.

1623
01:25:25.318 --> 01:25:25.985 size:60%
Petite Tomme de Savois.

1624
01:25:26.052 --> 01:25:27.752 size:60%
It’s my favorite cheese!

1625
01:25:27.819 --> 01:25:29.885 size:60%
This cheese made
it here all the way from France!

1626
01:25:33.351 --> 01:25:33.718 size:60%
Goddamn.

1627
01:25:35.885 --> 01:25:39.052 size:60%
No way!
It’s not normally like that!

1628
01:25:40.985 --> 01:25:42.451 size:60%
-That really stinks!
-For real, dude!

1629
01:25:44.085 --> 01:25:48.119 size:60%
Ah! I’m going to throw up, bro!
Oh! But I’m gonna still try it!

1630
01:25:49.618 --> 01:25:50.451 size:60%
Wait, hold on!

1631
01:25:50.919 --> 01:25:51.985 size:60%
Okay, you guys...

1632
01:25:52.052 --> 01:25:53.485 size:60%
it got a little warm, but...

1633
01:25:53.552 --> 01:25:54.585 size:60%
it doesn’t look too bad.

1634
01:25:58.718 --> 01:25:59.585 size:60%
Oh, man...

1635
01:26:00.652 --> 01:26:02.919 size:60%
Oh my god! This is absolutely
amazing!

1636
01:26:02.985 --> 01:26:03.718 size:60%
Is it good or not?

1637
01:26:03.752 --> 01:26:05.019 size:60%
Yeah, it’s good, good!
Yeah! It’s good!

1638
01:26:05.085 --> 01:26:06.585 size:60%
Oh my god! That’s France!

1639
01:26:11.685 --> 01:26:13.718 size:60%
-You like it?
-It’s good.

1640
01:26:15.652 --> 01:26:16.685 size:60%
Is it good or not?

1641
01:26:17.119 --> 01:26:18.952 size:60%
Yes, yes! It’s good!

1642
01:26:23.885 --> 01:26:24.552 size:60%
I’m on fire!

1643
01:26:27.985 --> 01:26:31.119 size:60%
We can discuss
which day is best to summit.

1644
01:26:32.418 --> 01:26:34.318 size:60%
I pray to
god that we will be successful

1645
01:26:34.385 --> 01:26:36.685 size:60%
and without injuries or problems.

1646
01:26:37.585 --> 01:26:38.518 size:60%
So, we...

1647
01:26:38.985 --> 01:26:40.852 size:60%
will try to summit
maybe like...

1648
01:26:41.119 --> 01:26:42.085 size:60%
uh, the 18th?

1649
01:26:42.485 --> 01:26:43.752 size:60%
Oh, but that’s 3 days away!

1650
01:26:44.652 --> 01:26:45.785 size:60%
The weather will be very good.

1651
01:26:45.919 --> 01:26:47.618 size:60%
If you think the
weather will be good...

1652
01:26:47.885 --> 01:26:49.119 size:60%
then for me, it’s not a problem.

1653
01:26:49.485 --> 01:26:51.019 size:60%
Tonight, all
our Sherpas are going to, uh...

1654
01:26:51.318 --> 01:26:53.019 size:60%
-To drop off... the oxygen.
-Oxygen, yeah.

1655
01:26:53.119 --> 01:26:54.852 size:60%
What do you think about the...
traffic?

1656
01:26:54.985 --> 01:26:57.418 size:60%
I think there will be...
less traffic.

1657
01:26:57.685 --> 01:26:58.919 size:60%
-Okay.
-Okay.

1658
01:26:59.485 --> 01:27:00.418 size:60%
Is the plan okay?

1659
01:27:00.518 --> 01:27:02.119 size:60%
Yeah.
I’m starting to get scared.

1660
01:27:02.385 --> 01:27:02.885 size:60%
Good?

1661
01:27:02.952 --> 01:27:05.351 size:60%
Thank you, Sonam,
thanks to the team.

1662
01:27:06.652 --> 01:27:08.685 size:60%
It’s good man, the
moment we’ve been waiting for!

1663
01:27:08.885 --> 01:27:10.485 size:60%
-One year!
-One year.

1664
01:27:10.518 --> 01:27:12.119 size:60%
Now it’s down to 3 days, man!

1665
01:27:17.552 --> 01:27:18.418 size:60%
I’m going to call
the weather router

1666
01:27:18.485 --> 01:27:19.985 size:60%
and say that the
Sherpas are saying...

1667
01:27:20.052 --> 01:27:21.085 size:60%
the 18th.

1668
01:27:21.451 --> 01:27:23.852 size:60%
What do you think? Because I
have the impression that it’s...

1669
01:27:24.019 --> 01:27:25.952 size:60%
I don’t know if it’s a good
idea to leave on the 18th.

1670
01:27:26.885 --> 01:27:29.052 size:60%
The 18th has
a beautiful morning then snow...

1671
01:27:29.119 --> 01:27:31.085 size:60%
From afternoon to evening,
there’s wind...

1672
01:27:31.552 --> 01:27:33.385 size:60%
wind and fog at all altitudes.

1673
01:27:34.718 --> 01:27:36.518 size:60%
I’m not climbing
Everest for nothing, man, right?

1674
01:27:37.451 --> 01:27:39.119 size:60%
If you’re all the way up there,
you want a nice view!

1675
01:27:39.318 --> 01:27:41.019 size:60%
The only other thing
that’s important is the wind.

1676
01:27:41.085 --> 01:27:42.052 size:60%
As for the fog...

1677
01:27:42.585 --> 01:27:45.019 size:60%
They’re saying fog, but I
want to go up to enjoy the view.

1678
01:27:45.385 --> 01:27:46.919 size:60%
I’m more afraid of the traffic,
you know?

1679
01:27:52.119 --> 01:27:53.552 size:60%
Man, that’s my phobia as well.

1680
01:27:53.618 --> 01:27:55.085 size:60%
Well, it’s coming up fast,
and I don’t want...

1681
01:27:55.119 --> 01:27:58.418 size:60%
to be the voice that’s...
pessimistic and all that, but...

1682
01:27:58.718 --> 01:28:00.718 size:60%
I don’t
want to be in a traffic jam.

1683
01:28:01.752 --> 01:28:02.952 size:60%
He doesn’t want anything.

1684
01:28:02.985 --> 01:28:04.119 size:60%
He doesn’t want fog,
or wind, or...

1685
01:28:04.485 --> 01:28:06.685 size:60%
Going to Everest is a
once in a lifetime thing!

1686
01:28:06.752 --> 01:28:09.052 size:60%
I’m not going to the top of
Everest if I can’t see anything.

1687
01:28:09.718 --> 01:28:10.985 size:60%
You shouldn’t place
too many constraints,

1688
01:28:11.052 --> 01:28:12.318 size:60%
or you’ll never go up!

1689
01:28:12.385 --> 01:28:14.652 size:60%
You shouldn’t think, “Oh,
there will be people, oh,

1690
01:28:14.718 --> 01:28:15.952 size:60%
there’s going to be wind, oh,

1691
01:28:16.019 --> 01:28:17.351 size:60%
there’s going to be fog,
oh, there’s going to be...

1692
01:28:17.718 --> 01:28:18.585 size:60%
Otherwise, you’ll...

1693
01:28:19.618 --> 01:28:20.685 size:60%
you’ll go in three years!

1694
01:28:20.852 --> 01:28:22.985 size:60%
I don’t have enough experience
to say what we should do.

1695
01:28:23.985 --> 01:28:25.518 size:60%
I’m placing my
trust in the team.

1696
01:28:30.418 --> 01:28:32.052 size:60%
There are 400 of
us in the camp...

1697
01:28:32.652 --> 01:28:34.819 size:60%
waiting for a
window so we can finally go up...

1698
01:28:35.351 --> 01:28:37.351 size:60%
That’s how the
traffic jams happen,

1699
01:28:37.418 --> 01:28:38.485 size:60%
just like the photos,
just like...

1700
01:28:38.718 --> 01:28:40.785 size:60%
everything we’ve seen on social
media,

1701
01:28:41.019 --> 01:28:42.451 size:60%
with the really long lines...

1702
01:28:43.752 --> 01:28:46.351 size:60%
There’s a window of
4-5 days without wind...

1703
01:28:46.852 --> 01:28:48.819 size:60%
So, all the climbers are
going to choose that slot.

1704
01:28:48.885 --> 01:28:50.585 size:60%
That’s why we’re
a bit apprehensive

1705
01:28:50.652 --> 01:28:52.119 size:60%
to find
ourselves stuck in traffic.

1706
01:28:52.652 --> 01:28:54.351 size:60%
I admit,
I have a knot in my stomach.

1707
01:28:56.652 --> 01:28:58.052 size:60%
We’re going to need
that for the end of the climb,

1708
01:28:58.119 --> 01:28:59.085 size:60%
because up there,

1709
01:28:59.318 --> 01:29:01.485 size:60%
there isn’t much
oxygen in the air.

1710
01:29:04.385 --> 01:29:05.919 size:60%
Dude,
this will be our life saver.

1711
01:29:06.385 --> 01:29:08.119 size:60%
-For sure.
-Dude, this is so crazy!

1712
01:29:09.318 --> 01:29:11.785 size:60%
We need to test the oxygen
mask to be sure everything works.

1713
01:29:11.885 --> 01:29:13.451 size:60%
So,
am I breathing the oxygen now?

1714
01:29:13.585 --> 01:29:14.885 size:60%
-No, it’s not on yet.
-Ah!

1715
01:29:15.718 --> 01:29:16.351 size:60%
It’s good.

1716
01:29:17.585 --> 01:29:18.518 size:60%
What the fuck?

1717
01:29:18.585 --> 01:29:19.652 size:60%
Is there
oxygen going through there?

1718
01:29:19.718 --> 01:29:21.985 size:60%
-Oh, yeah.
-But I can feel it in my stomach!

1719
01:29:22.019 --> 01:29:22.618 size:60%
Like you’re hungry?

1720
01:29:22.685 --> 01:29:24.019 size:60%
Yeah! What the fuck, man?!

1721
01:29:24.085 --> 01:29:24.785 size:60%
But dude,

1722
01:29:24.852 --> 01:29:26.552 size:60%
you feel it right away!

1723
01:29:27.618 --> 01:29:28.919 size:60%
Do you see the
energy it gave me?!

1724
01:29:29.052 --> 01:29:30.418 size:60%
Well, I’ve never tried it,
so I don’t know...

1725
01:29:30.451 --> 01:29:32.085 size:60%
Then wait, try it, try it!
You’ll be shocked!

1726
01:29:34.618 --> 01:29:36.085 size:60%
Don’t you feel like
you’re breathing easily?

1727
01:29:36.119 --> 01:29:37.351 size:60%
No, it’s not giving me chills.

1728
01:29:37.485 --> 01:29:39.019 size:60%
-But don’t you feel good now?
-It makes you feel good.

1729
01:29:39.085 --> 01:29:41.019 size:60%
-Oh yeah, so much better!
-It makes you feel good.

1730
01:29:41.119 --> 01:29:42.919 size:60%
It makes a major difference!

1731
01:29:43.351 --> 01:29:44.085 size:60%
Damn it’s heavy.

1732
01:29:44.119 --> 01:29:46.485 size:60%
But dude, having this on
your back for the whole climb...

1733
01:29:48.385 --> 01:29:49.518 size:60%
It would last 5 hours.

1734
01:29:50.718 --> 01:29:52.718 size:60%
Having oxygen is a major asset.

1735
01:29:52.785 --> 01:29:53.752 size:60%
Some come without it,

1736
01:29:53.819 --> 01:29:55.451 size:60%
and they should be
congratulated because man,

1737
01:29:55.485 --> 01:29:57.418 size:60%
doing
Everest without oxygen is a feat.

1738
01:29:58.819 --> 01:30:00.085 size:60%
Without oxygen is a hundred times
harder.

1739
01:30:00.752 --> 01:30:01.819 size:60%
For real, a hundred times harder.

1740
01:30:11.652 --> 01:30:12.718 size:60%
Whoa, dude!

1741
01:30:13.485 --> 01:30:14.852 size:60%
I thought it was a helicopter!

1742
01:30:14.952 --> 01:30:16.351 size:60%
Not a helicopter, an avalanche!

1743
01:30:17.985 --> 01:30:19.385 size:60%
Looked at that, it’s huge!

1744
01:30:20.685 --> 01:30:23.418 size:60%
But man, the
avalanche isn’t that far from us!

1745
01:30:24.985 --> 01:30:26.652 size:60%
Damn there’s more.

1746
01:30:27.318 --> 01:30:27.952 size:60%
It’s moving.

1747
01:30:28.385 --> 01:30:29.385 size:60%
The seracs are breaking.

1748
01:30:29.552 --> 01:30:31.885 size:60%
We just have to be sure not to
be under one when we go up.

1749
01:30:31.985 --> 01:30:33.885 size:60%
It’s better
it falls all day today...

1750
01:30:33.952 --> 01:30:35.351 size:60%
so tomorrow will be okay!

1751
01:30:35.785 --> 01:30:37.351 size:60%
Mathis gave me this mask.

1752
01:30:37.418 --> 01:30:38.752 size:60%
When it gets really cold,

1753
01:30:38.819 --> 01:30:40.819 size:60%
your throat might burn with
the air at minus 30 degrees.

1754
01:30:40.952 --> 01:30:41.985 size:60%
If you use the mask,
it allows you

1755
01:30:42.052 --> 01:30:44.451 size:60%
to keep the humidity
and the heat in your mouth.

1756
01:30:44.552 --> 01:30:45.518 size:60%
I don’t want to hurt my throat,

1757
01:30:45.685 --> 01:30:47.351 size:60%
so I’ll go
to Everest Camp 2 with this.

1758
01:30:50.552 --> 01:30:50.985 size:60%
Tomorrow...

1759
01:30:51.685 --> 01:30:52.119 size:60%
That’s right...

1760
01:30:52.585 --> 01:30:53.019 size:60%
Damn, man...

1761
01:30:53.552 --> 01:30:54.552 size:60%
Dude, I’m a little scared.

1762
01:30:56.585 --> 01:30:57.451 size:60%
I admit that...

1763
01:30:57.518 --> 01:30:59.819 size:60%
since we’re hearing
blocks fall day and night...

1764
01:31:00.418 --> 01:31:01.485 size:60%
it’s a little stressful, but...

1765
01:31:01.618 --> 01:31:02.752 size:60%
it’ll be fine, I know it will.

1766
01:31:03.919 --> 01:31:06.351 size:60%
Hey old man! How are you doing?

1767
01:31:06.418 --> 01:31:07.852 size:60%
Bro, I miss you! So...

1768
01:31:08.585 --> 01:31:10.819 size:60%
Yeah, long time no see,
right, bro?

1769
01:31:10.885 --> 01:31:11.652 size:60%
Have you done any research yet?

1770
01:31:11.752 --> 01:31:14.518 size:60%
Man, I left my phone in Paris
a month and a half ago, dude.

1771
01:31:14.885 --> 01:31:16.785 size:60%
Mathis gave me his
phone so I could call you

1772
01:31:16.885 --> 01:31:18.785 size:60%
The best thing
is for you to stay disconnected

1773
01:31:18.852 --> 01:31:19.885 size:60%
and just focus on Everest.

1774
01:31:19.985 --> 01:31:21.085 size:60%
I’m going tomorrow, bro!

1775
01:31:21.351 --> 01:31:23.385 size:60%
Oh, that’s crazy!
How long will it take?

1776
01:31:23.585 --> 01:31:25.518 size:60%
4 days. It’s tomorrow man!

1777
01:31:25.585 --> 01:31:26.518 size:60%
It’s, it’s tomorrow!

1778
01:31:26.685 --> 01:31:28.685 size:60%
Bro, give
it your all and you’ll make it.

1779
01:31:28.752 --> 01:31:30.819 size:60%
What you’re doing right now is
crazy. Enjoy yourself.

1780
01:31:30.952 --> 01:31:31.685 size:60%
Aw, man I...

1781
01:31:31.752 --> 01:31:32.985 size:60%
Shonen Spirit all the way.

1782
01:31:33.052 --> 01:31:34.852 size:60%
Remember,
your strength is in your mind.

1783
01:31:37.085 --> 01:31:38.485 size:60%
Inès did really well.

1784
01:31:38.552 --> 01:31:40.718 size:60%
We’ve
been training for a whole year,

1785
01:31:40.785 --> 01:31:43.119 size:60%
and he really put his all
into training and into preparing

1786
01:31:43.351 --> 01:31:44.085 size:60%
for this project.

1787
01:31:46.518 --> 01:31:47.685 size:60%
A year of preparation

1788
01:31:47.752 --> 01:31:49.052 size:60%
may seem pretty short,

1789
01:31:49.119 --> 01:31:51.952 size:60%
but Inès was so dedicated,
and he was super disciplined.

1790
01:31:52.019 --> 01:31:54.351 size:60%
He gave it his all for 360 days.

1791
01:31:54.418 --> 01:31:56.119 size:60%
It was all he thought about,

1792
01:31:56.318 --> 01:31:57.652 size:60%
whether he
was eating or he was training...

1793
01:31:57.718 --> 01:31:58.985 size:60%
That’s the same as

1794
01:31:59.052 --> 01:32:01.652 size:60%
5-6 years of preparation.
And today he’s at the top.

1795
01:32:01.785 --> 01:32:02.752 size:60%
You know, I’m so happy.

1796
01:32:02.819 --> 01:32:03.385 size:60%
Dude...

1797
01:32:03.552 --> 01:32:05.785 size:60%
it’s a year
of work for four days of...

1798
01:32:05.852 --> 01:32:06.985 size:60%
of mountain climbing.

1799
01:32:07.451 --> 01:32:08.718 size:60%
He knows how to climb well,

1800
01:32:08.785 --> 01:32:09.885 size:60%
he’s comfortable with the
equipment,

1801
01:32:09.952 --> 01:32:12.552 size:60%
he knows how to attach,
he knows how to climb the rope...

1802
01:32:12.819 --> 01:32:15.585 size:60%
That guarantees
safety and speed as well.

1803
01:32:17.752 --> 01:32:18.718 size:60%
I’m so stressed, man.

1804
01:32:19.351 --> 01:32:21.618 size:60%
I admit that my stomach
gets in a knot before a climb.

1805
01:32:22.119 --> 01:32:23.052 size:60%
It’ll be fine.

1806
01:32:24.019 --> 01:32:24.985 size:60%
I hope it’ll be fine.

1807
01:32:30.652 --> 01:32:32.019 size:60%
Staying safe is the real goal...

1808
01:32:33.385 --> 01:32:34.552 size:60%
and getting back alive.

1809
01:32:36.785 --> 01:32:38.052 size:60%
You’re crazy to follow me here...

1810
01:32:38.618 --> 01:32:39.819 size:60%
because I like to take risks.

1811
01:32:40.385 --> 01:32:42.618 size:60%
Yeah, you take risks,
the mountains are always a risk.

1812
01:32:42.819 --> 01:32:44.318 size:60%
It’s a lot of factors combined,

1813
01:32:44.385 --> 01:32:45.819 size:60%
which is why
the experience you’ve acquired...

1814
01:32:45.885 --> 01:32:47.485 size:60%
Well,
it’s time to put it to the test.

1815
01:32:48.852 --> 01:32:50.518 size:60%
Inès had an impact on me.

1816
01:32:50.919 --> 01:32:52.518 size:60%
His way of being, his energy...

1817
01:32:52.652 --> 01:32:54.351 size:60%
Honestly, he’s super inspiring.

1818
01:32:54.718 --> 01:32:56.019 size:60%
We did it, brother!

1819
01:32:56.385 --> 01:32:57.952 size:60%
We’ve both grown
with this project, and...

1820
01:32:58.119 --> 01:33:01.085 size:60%
I’m so happy to be
with you today and do the summit.

1821
01:33:03.652 --> 01:33:05.652 size:60%
Before we start climbing,
I’d like to thank everyone...

1822
01:33:05.785 --> 01:33:07.418 size:60%
who supported me
throughout the project,

1823
01:33:07.518 --> 01:33:09.652 size:60%
everyone who encouraged me,
because every day I heard,

1824
01:33:09.718 --> 01:33:10.685 size:60%
“Good luck with Everest.”

1825
01:33:10.752 --> 01:33:12.752 size:60%
I’ve been hearing that
for a year, so thank you.

1826
01:33:13.019 --> 01:33:13.985 size:60%
-Good luck with Everest.
-Thank you.

1827
01:33:14.119 --> 01:33:15.785 size:60%
-To the summit!
-For sure!

1828
01:33:17.351 --> 01:33:18.985 size:60%
Even that guy’s encouraging me.

1829
01:33:19.052 --> 01:33:21.885 size:60%
Before going up,
I want to thank you and everyone.

1830
01:33:22.019 --> 01:33:24.518 size:60%
My whole team who
believes in me and the project.

1831
01:33:24.618 --> 01:33:26.085 size:60%
Thanks also to the criticizers.

1832
01:33:26.385 --> 01:33:27.718 size:60%
It allowed me to
question myself...

1833
01:33:28.618 --> 01:33:29.385 size:60%
about many things...

1834
01:33:29.852 --> 01:33:31.119 size:60%
and become even better.

1835
01:33:36.685 --> 01:33:38.385 size:60%
So,
Sunday at 6am you’ll be up there?

1836
01:33:38.485 --> 01:33:39.785 size:60%
Yeah... I should be.

1837
01:33:40.552 --> 01:33:42.552 size:60%
-Well, be careful, okay, son?
-Yeah.

1838
01:33:42.752 --> 01:33:44.552 size:60%
Remember,
I’m here to push you up,

1839
01:33:44.618 --> 01:33:45.985 size:60%
and I’m here to hold you down.

1840
01:33:46.752 --> 01:33:47.652 size:60%
In case, uh...

1841
01:33:47.819 --> 01:33:48.618 size:60%
something happens...

1842
01:33:48.785 --> 01:33:49.752 size:60%
just know that...

1843
01:33:50.052 --> 01:33:51.418 size:60%
I had the best life ever.

1844
01:33:54.451 --> 01:33:55.052 size:60%
How are you?

1845
01:33:55.952 --> 01:33:57.652 size:60%
-And you?
-Yeah,

1846
01:33:57.885 --> 01:33:59.119 size:60%
-I have good news.
-You okay?

1847
01:33:59.451 --> 01:34:00.652 size:60%
-I have good news.
-Yeah?

1848
01:34:00.952 --> 01:34:01.885 size:60%
I’m leaving tonight.

1849
01:34:02.785 --> 01:34:06.119 size:60%
-Oh, it’s time! Tonight?
-It is. It’s the big night.

1850
01:34:07.318 --> 01:34:08.418 size:60%
Oh, that’s great!

1851
01:34:09.351 --> 01:34:10.952 size:60%
-My goodness.
-So, anyway...

1852
01:34:11.119 --> 01:34:12.718 size:60%
I wanted to tell
you before I left.

1853
01:34:13.552 --> 01:34:14.752 size:60%
That’s wonderful, sweetheart.

1854
01:34:15.085 --> 01:34:16.518 size:60%
I’ll be rooting for you.

1855
01:34:16.685 --> 01:34:17.485 size:60%
Now, it’s gonna be...

1856
01:34:17.552 --> 01:34:18.885 size:60%
Actually, I don’t know
if it’s going to be hard,

1857
01:34:18.952 --> 01:34:19.885 size:60%
I don’t if it’s...

1858
01:34:19.952 --> 01:34:21.385 size:60%
I have no idea.

1859
01:34:22.119 --> 01:34:24.119 size:60%
-I honestly have no idea.
-But that’s good!

1860
01:34:24.518 --> 01:34:27.552 size:60%
You know, you shouldn’t
feel apprehensive prematurely,

1861
01:34:27.618 --> 01:34:29.351 size:60%
just take things as they come.

1862
01:34:29.418 --> 01:34:31.952 size:60%
Don’t try to figure out
what you’re going to be feeling!

1863
01:34:32.019 --> 01:34:34.952 size:60%
You’ll feel what you need to
feel when the time comes, okay?

1864
01:34:34.985 --> 01:34:39.585 size:60%
Go forward, and observe,
and listen, and breathe calmly...

1865
01:34:40.618 --> 01:34:42.318 size:60%
Think of me on the 19th...

1866
01:34:42.552 --> 01:34:43.618 size:60%
I’ll be suffering.

1867
01:34:44.485 --> 01:34:45.919 size:60%
I think of you every day.

1868
01:34:46.485 --> 01:34:47.119 size:60%
Every single day.

1869
01:34:48.952 --> 01:34:49.618 size:60%
Big kiss, Mom.

1870
01:34:51.552 --> 01:34:52.985 size:60%
All right, let’s do this.

1871
01:34:54.685 --> 01:34:55.785 size:60%
It’s time to get going.

1872
01:35:19.552 --> 01:35:20.585 size:60%
It’s finally time...

1873
01:35:23.418 --> 01:35:24.518 size:60%
No matter what happens...

1874
01:35:24.718 --> 01:35:25.752 size:60%
no regrets, man.

1875
01:35:26.318 --> 01:35:27.119 size:60%
No regrets.

1876
01:35:33.652 --> 01:35:34.485 size:60%
The Icefall.

1877
01:35:36.618 --> 01:35:38.685 size:60%
This is one of the most
dangerous stages of the climb.

1878
01:35:40.518 --> 01:35:42.885 size:60%
An unstable glacier that
moves one meter per day.

1879
01:35:44.351 --> 01:35:45.685 size:60%
With huge blocks of ice

1880
01:35:45.752 --> 01:35:47.119 size:60%
that can collapse at any moment.

1881
01:35:47.752 --> 01:35:49.985 size:60%
We’re going to have to
cross it all today in order

1882
01:35:50.351 --> 01:35:52.685 size:60%
to reach the first camp
where we’ll be sleeping tonight.

1883
01:36:23.052 --> 01:36:24.052 size:60%
Look at that, bro!

1884
01:36:24.718 --> 01:36:25.785 size:60%
It’s like a building!

1885
01:36:25.852 --> 01:36:27.685 size:60%
If that falls on your face,
it’s over!

1886
01:36:31.852 --> 01:36:33.085 size:60%
When you go under it...

1887
01:36:33.718 --> 01:36:34.685 size:60%
you can’t hang around!

1888
01:36:35.652 --> 01:36:37.552 size:60%
Expose yourself
the least possible.

1889
01:36:40.418 --> 01:36:41.718 size:60%
Go ahead,
we won’t stay too long.

1890
01:36:57.652 --> 01:36:58.718 size:60%
From this point on,

1891
01:36:58.785 --> 01:37:00.952 size:60%
we’re going to start
hanging on to the fixed rope,

1892
01:37:01.019 --> 01:37:02.451 size:60%
because there are
some really big holes.

1893
01:37:03.919 --> 01:37:05.485 size:60%
Holy shit!

1894
01:37:06.752 --> 01:37:07.985 size:60%
Dude, that’s 30 meters!

1895
01:37:14.518 --> 01:37:16.518 size:60%
Dude why is the drop so crazy?!

1896
01:37:20.518 --> 01:37:21.085 size:60%
Oh my god!

1897
01:37:21.685 --> 01:37:23.451 size:60%
Come here... give me your hand.

1898
01:37:26.752 --> 01:37:28.019 size:60%
Oh my god, oh my god!

1899
01:37:28.085 --> 01:37:30.451 size:60%
That was so terrifying, bro!

1900
01:37:32.351 --> 01:37:33.652 size:60%
You have to put
your toes forward.

1901
01:37:33.718 --> 01:37:34.019 size:60%
Okay.

1902
01:37:34.518 --> 01:37:35.585 size:60%
So, toes forward.

1903
01:37:35.652 --> 01:37:37.451 size:60%
Point your toes forward.
Like this, okay?

1904
01:37:38.485 --> 01:37:39.351 size:60%
Nice, Sonam!

1905
01:37:39.685 --> 01:37:40.819 size:60%
Nice, brother!

1906
01:37:41.518 --> 01:37:43.351 size:60%
This passage has
quite a few ladders!

1907
01:37:49.752 --> 01:37:50.819 size:60%
Use the front spikes...

1908
01:37:51.685 --> 01:37:52.785 size:60%
Okay, front spikes...

1909
01:38:50.718 --> 01:38:51.819 size:60%
Look at the people.

1910
01:38:52.318 --> 01:38:53.485 size:60%
Wait, where?
Where are the people?

1911
01:38:54.318 --> 01:38:56.485 size:60%
What?! What the hell?!

1912
01:38:58.885 --> 01:38:59.852 size:60%
It’s mind-blowing.

1913
01:39:00.119 --> 01:39:03.351 size:60%
I didn’t think it would be
like this. I’m in total shock!

1914
01:39:03.718 --> 01:39:05.652 size:60%
Dude,
at the top it must be insane!

1915
01:39:05.752 --> 01:39:06.819 size:60%
I sure hope not.

1916
01:39:07.985 --> 01:39:09.985 size:60%
It’s like what we saw on
the internet right, Mathis?

1917
01:39:10.685 --> 01:39:11.819 size:60%
Now we’re living it.

1918
01:39:12.652 --> 01:39:14.518 size:60%
It’s because
this passage is quite technical.

1919
01:39:14.618 --> 01:39:15.785 size:60%
You really have to pull a lot...

1920
01:39:15.952 --> 01:39:17.518 size:60%
so it takes a time,
and that’s why...

1921
01:39:17.552 --> 01:39:18.052 size:60%
it’s backed up.

1922
01:39:18.518 --> 01:39:19.752 size:60%
We’re going
to have to wait...

1923
01:39:19.819 --> 01:39:22.119 size:60%
-a good hour.
-Holy shit, man.

1924
01:39:22.585 --> 01:39:24.052 size:60%
At least we’re towards the front.
It could be worse.

1925
01:39:24.351 --> 01:39:25.819 size:60%
It must be even worse behind us!

1926
01:39:25.919 --> 01:39:26.985 size:60%
Oh my god, man!

1927
01:39:27.385 --> 01:39:28.385 size:60%
Oh my god!

1928
01:39:28.451 --> 01:39:30.952 size:60%
But dude, what the hell is this!

1929
01:39:31.052 --> 01:39:32.019 size:60%
-It’s hell.
-It’s insane!

1930
01:39:32.085 --> 01:39:33.085 size:60%
It’s like the
beginning of a horror movie!

1931
01:39:33.351 --> 01:39:35.019 size:60%
Or a movie where
the world is ending!

1932
01:39:35.052 --> 01:39:36.052 size:60%
It’s hell on Earth.

1933
01:39:36.451 --> 01:39:38.852 size:60%
There’s a serac right above us.
If it falls, we’re done for.

1934
01:39:38.952 --> 01:39:41.885 size:60%
-Yeah. Don’t worry, I saw it.
-Oh my god, you guys...

1935
01:39:41.952 --> 01:39:44.052 size:60%
I’d rather not look at it either!

1936
01:39:44.119 --> 01:39:46.785 size:60%
Especially since there’s
a crevasse that could form

1937
01:39:46.852 --> 01:39:48.485 size:60%
at any moment under Sonam’s feet,
man!

1938
01:39:48.919 --> 01:39:50.119 size:60%
Mathis is stunned.

1939
01:39:50.451 --> 01:39:52.351 size:60%
I’ve only been
mountaineering for a year,

1940
01:39:52.418 --> 01:39:54.819 size:60%
but Mathis is a pro,
and he’s in shock right now.

1941
01:39:54.885 --> 01:39:55.919 size:60%
If the guys were prepared...

1942
01:39:55.985 --> 01:39:57.618 size:60%
if they had the skills...

1943
01:39:57.652 --> 01:39:57.985 size:60%
Yeah!

1944
01:39:58.119 --> 01:39:59.718 size:60%
-it’d go by quick!
-They’d be quicker.

1945
01:39:59.785 --> 01:40:00.119 size:60%
Yeah!

1946
01:40:00.585 --> 01:40:02.318 size:60%
But they don’t even know how
to attach themselves to the rope.

1947
01:40:02.385 --> 01:40:03.819 size:60%
No, these
guys don’t know how to climb.

1948
01:40:03.885 --> 01:40:05.418 size:60%
They don’t know how
to put the jumar on or anything,

1949
01:40:05.485 --> 01:40:06.518 size:60%
so it’s taking forever.

1950
01:40:07.119 --> 01:40:09.085 size:60%
That’s the problem.
It’s not the number of people.

1951
01:40:09.618 --> 01:40:11.385 size:60%
Dude, how long have
we been waiting under that serac?

1952
01:40:11.451 --> 01:40:13.052 size:60%
We’ve been under
it for an hour now,

1953
01:40:13.119 --> 01:40:14.085 size:60%
and it could fall at any moment!

1954
01:40:14.451 --> 01:40:16.318 size:60%
Exactly. Well, if it does breaks,
it’ll make a nice hole.

1955
01:40:16.385 --> 01:40:17.852 size:60%
Sonam,
is it the first time like this?

1956
01:40:18.585 --> 01:40:20.785 size:60%
-No? It’s always like this?
-Always.

1957
01:40:21.085 --> 01:40:23.119 size:60%
I got us into a mess,
I’m sorry bro.

1958
01:40:23.585 --> 01:40:24.119 size:60%
Yeah, well...

1959
01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:25.952 size:60%
Maybe we were in
too much of a hurry.

1960
01:40:26.885 --> 01:40:28.351 size:60%
You think we’ll
make it to Camp 2?

1961
01:40:28.952 --> 01:40:29.652 size:60%
I hope so.

1962
01:40:29.718 --> 01:40:30.618 size:60%
Yeah, me too.

1963
01:40:30.685 --> 01:40:31.952 size:60%
But there are so many people...

1964
01:40:32.652 --> 01:40:33.585 size:60%
I’m telling you...

1965
01:40:33.852 --> 01:40:36.518 size:60%
I don’t wanna lose any fingers,
and I don’t wanna die.

1966
01:40:36.819 --> 01:40:37.585 size:60%
Me neither.

1967
01:40:53.485 --> 01:40:54.585 size:60%
We’ve been walking for 6 hours.

1968
01:40:55.785 --> 01:40:57.052 size:60%
We’re finally at Camp 1.

1969
01:41:01.552 --> 01:41:02.485 size:60%
Camp 1!

1970
01:41:03.052 --> 01:41:04.652 size:60%
The first step is done.

1971
01:41:05.085 --> 01:41:05.885 size:60%
So, I’m...

1972
01:41:06.685 --> 01:41:07.618 size:60%
at Camp 1.

1973
01:41:08.485 --> 01:41:09.585 size:60%
Three more to go.

1974
01:41:09.852 --> 01:41:10.785 size:60%
Are you tired?

1975
01:41:12.418 --> 01:41:12.985 size:60%
I wanna go to sleep.

1976
01:41:13.052 --> 01:41:14.119 size:60%
Did you tap into
the reserves yet?

1977
01:41:14.552 --> 01:41:16.119 size:60%
No, not yet,
but I do wanna sleep.

1978
01:41:20.552 --> 01:41:22.451 size:60%
So, we’re here...
we’ve set up the tent.

1979
01:41:23.019 --> 01:41:23.685 size:60%
And now...

1980
01:41:24.552 --> 01:41:27.318 size:60%
we’re inflating these, so...
There’s not much oxygen, but...

1981
01:41:27.718 --> 01:41:28.318 size:60%
Look there.

1982
01:41:28.451 --> 01:41:29.451 size:60%
That’s the top of Everest.

1983
01:41:29.819 --> 01:41:31.052 size:60%
I’m inflating my mattress...

1984
01:41:31.585 --> 01:41:33.518 size:60%
with a view of the top of
Everest. It’s so beautiful.

1985
01:41:36.752 --> 01:41:38.752 size:60%
Honestly, Camp 1 isn’t
great in terms of security.

1986
01:41:38.819 --> 01:41:39.085 size:60%
Yeah.

1987
01:41:39.785 --> 01:41:40.652 size:60%
Especially since...

1988
01:41:40.718 --> 01:41:41.852 size:60%
Dude,
where are we the on the snow?

1989
01:41:41.985 --> 01:41:42.919 size:60%
Well, we’re on huge holes.

1990
01:41:42.985 --> 01:41:44.685 size:60%
So,
we’re on these huge holes man!

1991
01:41:44.752 --> 01:41:45.785 size:60%
I’ve never seen holes like that.

1992
01:41:45.885 --> 01:41:47.052 size:60%
At any moment...

1993
01:41:47.552 --> 01:41:49.518 size:60%
a hole could open up!

1994
01:41:49.752 --> 01:41:50.819 size:60%
Dude, they’re actually canyons.

1995
01:41:50.919 --> 01:41:52.418 size:60%
Bro, they’re canyons!

1996
01:41:55.585 --> 01:41:56.819 size:60%
Tomorrow we’re going to Camp 2.

1997
01:41:57.418 --> 01:41:58.585 size:60%
It should take us a less time.

1998
01:41:58.852 --> 01:42:00.518 size:60%
To get to Camp 2? 2 or 3 hours.

1999
01:42:12.518 --> 01:42:13.952 size:60%
I was woken
up by the storm outside.

2000
01:42:14.985 --> 01:42:16.119 size:60%
I didn’t sleep at all.

2001
01:42:21.618 --> 01:42:22.685 size:60%
This is a real mess!

2002
01:42:25.785 --> 01:42:28.351 size:60%
Mathis told me that
Manish is seriously ill.

2003
01:42:28.552 --> 01:42:29.052 size:60%
Manish!

2004
01:42:29.318 --> 01:42:30.919 size:60%
-Yeah!
-Are you good?

2005
01:42:31.852 --> 01:42:32.952 size:60%
How are you doing, brother?

2006
01:42:33.618 --> 01:42:37.385 size:60%
I’m vomiting.
But that’s normal for me.

2007
01:42:37.819 --> 01:42:40.385 size:60%
-What are you gonna do?
-I’m gonna take some medicine.

2008
01:42:40.618 --> 01:42:42.785 size:60%
So, are you coming with us,
or are you turning back?

2009
01:42:42.985 --> 01:42:44.718 size:60%
-I’m going with you.
-Are you sure?

2010
01:42:44.752 --> 01:42:45.485 size:60%
Yeah.

2011
01:42:45.585 --> 01:42:48.785 size:60%
If you need to recover...
go back, man. It’s okay.

2012
01:42:49.085 --> 01:42:50.385 size:60%
Let’s go to Camp 2.

2013
01:42:55.919 --> 01:42:57.085 size:60%
Time for Camp 2.

2014
01:43:24.518 --> 01:43:25.685 size:60%
It’s not easy.

2015
01:43:52.585 --> 01:43:53.451 size:60%
Yeah, bro!

2016
01:43:55.518 --> 01:43:56.318 size:60%
Dude, it’s...

2017
01:43:57.119 --> 01:43:58.019 size:60%
Goddamn...

2018
01:44:04.585 --> 01:44:06.752 size:60%
It took it out of us today,
for real.

2019
01:44:07.652 --> 01:44:10.119 size:60%
And if we
can’t recover at 6500 meters...

2020
01:44:10.618 --> 01:44:12.785 size:60%
Yeah, mentally it’s...

2021
01:44:26.585 --> 01:44:27.985 size:60%
Damn,
and it’s only the beginning...

2022
01:44:28.785 --> 01:44:29.985 size:60%
Mentally, this is torture.

2023
01:44:30.752 --> 01:44:32.119 size:60%
Mentally, this is torture.

2024
01:44:32.485 --> 01:44:34.451 size:60%
I’ve already suffered so much,
and we just started.

2025
01:44:35.485 --> 01:44:36.618 size:60%
It’s a slap in the face.

2026
01:44:37.451 --> 01:44:39.585 size:60%
Once you get over 6000,
you realize what it’s like.

2027
01:44:40.919 --> 01:44:42.952 size:60%
It’s honestly
like you’re on another planet.

2028
01:44:43.385 --> 01:44:45.351 size:60%
This place
wasn’t made for humans, man.

2029
01:44:49.919 --> 01:44:50.819 size:60%
How is Manish?

2030
01:44:51.385 --> 01:44:51.952 size:60%
He has...

2031
01:44:52.351 --> 01:44:55.618 size:60%
altitude sickness,
right now. He keeps vomiting.

2032
01:44:55.752 --> 01:44:56.618 size:60%
Is he on oxygen?

2033
01:44:57.052 --> 01:44:59.518 size:60%
-How’s his oxygen?
-Yeah, I gave him oxygen.

2034
01:45:02.752 --> 01:45:05.985 size:60%
Hey, brother.
You’ll get back on your feet.

2035
01:45:06.019 --> 01:45:06.618 size:60%
Yeah.

2036
01:45:07.618 --> 01:45:08.785 size:60%
-Okay?
-Yes.

2037
01:45:08.952 --> 01:45:09.785 size:60%
Get well!

2038
01:45:10.952 --> 01:45:12.852 size:60%
-Get well, brother!
-Yes, brother.

2039
01:45:13.985 --> 01:45:16.052 size:60%
-I’m sure you’ll get better.
-Yeah, yeah.

2040
01:45:17.752 --> 01:45:18.585 size:60%
I hope so.

2041
01:45:18.952 --> 01:45:21.785 size:60%
Manish isn’t well. We’re
gonna stay here another day.

2042
01:45:21.885 --> 01:45:22.752 size:60%
Tomorrow morning,

2043
01:45:22.819 --> 01:45:24.685 size:60%
if his body is okay and fine...

2044
01:45:24.752 --> 01:45:26.652 size:60%
then we’ll take off. If not...

2045
01:45:27.451 --> 01:45:29.052 size:60%
-No summit?
-Yeah, no summit.

2046
01:45:31.852 --> 01:45:33.418 size:60%
Damn, that’s so annoying.

2047
01:45:35.119 --> 01:45:36.451 size:60%
If he’s really sick...

2048
01:45:36.718 --> 01:45:38.819 size:60%
-we can’t risk it.
-Yeah.

2049
01:45:42.052 --> 01:45:43.718 size:60%
But I wanted to do
the summit with him.

2050
01:45:46.318 --> 01:45:47.819 size:60%
I’m so, so tired.

2051
01:45:48.885 --> 01:45:50.085 size:60%
Let’s hope tomorrow is better.

2052
01:45:52.785 --> 01:45:54.485 size:60%
But it’s crazy because...

2053
01:45:58.019 --> 01:45:59.351 size:60%
I don’t know if I can make it.

2054
01:46:01.085 --> 01:46:02.119 size:60%
It’s so far away, that...

2055
01:46:02.418 --> 01:46:03.385 size:60%
I keep thinking...

2056
01:46:03.952 --> 01:46:05.318 size:60%
of how much needs to be done...

2057
01:46:07.919 --> 01:46:08.819 size:60%
I keep thinking...

2058
01:46:09.885 --> 01:46:10.919 size:60%
Can I really do this?

2059
01:46:12.952 --> 01:46:14.885 size:60%
Especially after
today’s reality check.

2060
01:46:18.652 --> 01:46:20.318 size:60%
It’s not easy, it’s not easy.

2061
01:46:20.919 --> 01:46:22.618 size:60%
This isn’t the place for us...

2062
01:46:24.119 --> 01:46:25.552 size:60%
We’re here at 6400 meters...

2063
01:46:27.785 --> 01:46:29.652 size:60%
and everything yet to come
is even worse.

2064
01:46:30.718 --> 01:46:31.752 size:60%
I’m scared man.

2065
01:46:34.085 --> 01:46:35.985 size:60%
-Guys, I think we have a problem.
-What?

2066
01:46:36.485 --> 01:46:37.518 size:60%
The weather has changed.

2067
01:46:38.752 --> 01:46:39.552 size:60%
And uh...

2068
01:46:40.451 --> 01:46:41.919 size:60%
basically, for the 20th...

2069
01:46:41.952 --> 01:46:42.618 size:60%
it was still good.

2070
01:46:42.919 --> 01:46:44.885 size:60%
But now, on the 20th,
they’re saying...

2071
01:46:44.985 --> 01:46:46.385 size:60%
-It’s bad.
-It’ll be windy.

2072
01:46:46.885 --> 01:46:48.819 size:60%
-Bro...
-That’s why, uh...

2073
01:46:49.618 --> 01:46:50.752 size:60%
they’re doing the 19th.

2074
01:46:50.885 --> 01:46:52.785 size:60%
Do we go up then? Now?

2075
01:46:53.518 --> 01:46:54.718 size:60%
Man, that’s not even an option.

2076
01:46:55.518 --> 01:46:57.718 size:60%
Bro, given the number of people
there are, I’d rather stay here.

2077
01:46:58.451 --> 01:46:59.451 size:60%
Look, you guys, I’m telling...

2078
01:46:59.718 --> 01:47:01.652 size:60%
the traffic up there is
almost more dangerous...

2079
01:47:02.351 --> 01:47:05.019 size:60%
than the wind. I think going now
would be a mistake.

2080
01:47:06.052 --> 01:47:07.019 size:60%
What do you think?

2081
01:47:07.585 --> 01:47:08.852 size:60%
You want to go now?

2082
01:47:13.119 --> 01:47:14.518 size:60%
So, we decided,

2083
01:47:14.618 --> 01:47:16.785 size:60%
that with
everything that’s going on...

2084
01:47:17.385 --> 01:47:19.418 size:60%
the 20th is the best.
So, we’ll follow that plan.

2085
01:47:19.518 --> 01:47:21.418 size:60%
I agree.
But are you sure the traffic...

2086
01:47:21.952 --> 01:47:25.318 size:60%
19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

2087
01:47:25.685 --> 01:47:26.885 size:60%
It will all be the same.

2088
01:47:28.685 --> 01:47:29.385 size:60%
All right?

2089
01:47:43.451 --> 01:47:44.351 size:60%
I here...

2090
01:47:44.785 --> 01:47:46.785 size:60%
in Camp 2 after a shitty night.

2091
01:47:47.919 --> 01:47:49.385 size:60%
Bring on the sun.

2092
01:47:49.518 --> 01:47:51.518 size:60%
We’re waiting
for the sun to hit the tent,

2093
01:47:51.652 --> 01:47:53.952 size:60%
because there’s only
been a windstorm since yesterday.

2094
01:47:56.618 --> 01:47:59.119 size:60%
Once the sun is out,
my mood will get better.

2095
01:48:00.919 --> 01:48:03.385 size:60%
-It was pretty noisy last night.
-Yeah, it was.

2096
01:48:03.518 --> 01:48:04.451 size:60%
At one point...

2097
01:48:10.385 --> 01:48:10.885 size:60%
The wind...

2098
01:48:11.985 --> 01:48:14.618 size:60%
There’s a crazy
windstorm happening at Camp 2.

2099
01:48:15.351 --> 01:48:16.318 size:60%
Last night, uh...

2100
01:48:16.385 --> 01:48:20.119 size:60%
about ten tents were blown away.
Below us, at the lower camps.

2101
01:48:20.919 --> 01:48:23.119 size:60%
We were lucky, but we slept badly

2102
01:48:23.318 --> 01:48:24.585 size:60%
because it was
pounding all night.

2103
01:48:27.318 --> 01:48:28.885 size:60%
As we’ve
said since the beginning,

2104
01:48:28.952 --> 01:48:30.085 size:60%
the weather is always a factor...

2105
01:48:31.518 --> 01:48:33.552 size:60%
It can affect the,
uh, the outcome.

2106
01:48:34.451 --> 01:48:36.351 size:60%
It can cause the journey to fail,
and it can...

2107
01:48:36.785 --> 01:48:38.752 size:60%
have an impact on our expedition.

2108
01:48:40.752 --> 01:48:41.652 size:60%
So, when...

2109
01:48:41.718 --> 01:48:43.685 size:60%
the weather is nicer,
we’ll go to the summit.

2110
01:48:43.852 --> 01:48:45.618 size:60%
For now, we’re
thinking about what to do here.

2111
01:48:45.819 --> 01:48:48.351 size:60%
Right now,
we could be at our homes...

2112
01:48:48.585 --> 01:48:50.952 size:60%
with our own fucking beds
and a hot shower.

2113
01:48:51.019 --> 01:48:52.019 size:60%
Oh, my god!

2114
01:48:52.085 --> 01:48:53.019 size:60%
Yeah, it’s true...

2115
01:48:53.085 --> 01:48:54.585 size:60%
you start
feeling stupid for being here.

2116
01:48:54.685 --> 01:48:56.351 size:60%
We’re two idiots in a tent.

2117
01:48:58.552 --> 01:48:59.819 size:60%
Two idiots in a tent.

2118
01:49:08.985 --> 01:49:11.952 size:60%
And what has the morning
brought us?! How are you, Manish?

2119
01:49:12.052 --> 01:49:13.952 size:60%
-I’m doing good!
-The comeback is...

2120
01:49:14.318 --> 01:49:15.318 size:60%
The comeback is real.

2121
01:49:15.385 --> 01:49:18.518 size:60%
It’s real, bro! Right?
I told you! The comeback is real!

2122
01:49:18.585 --> 01:49:19.019 size:60%
Yeah.

2123
01:49:19.351 --> 01:49:21.985 size:60%
My bro. Manish is making
his comeback! Your comeback!

2124
01:49:22.119 --> 01:49:24.119 size:60%
-I’m back!
-You’re back!

2125
01:49:24.752 --> 01:49:25.552 size:60%
Hey, Manish?

2126
01:49:25.718 --> 01:49:27.852 size:60%
Last night you sure
weren’t like that, huh?

2127
01:49:28.885 --> 01:49:29.685 size:60%
You were like...

2128
01:49:30.485 --> 01:49:31.518 size:60%
“Good night, bro!”

2129
01:49:34.718 --> 01:49:35.552 size:60%
How are you, Charles?

2130
01:49:36.418 --> 01:49:39.019 size:60%
Charles is also climbing Everest,
and he joined us.

2131
01:49:39.552 --> 01:49:40.952 size:60%
A little before 11am...

2132
01:49:41.451 --> 01:49:42.451 size:60%
uh, this morning...

2133
01:49:42.518 --> 01:49:43.718 size:60%
at the top of the climb...

2134
01:49:43.852 --> 01:49:44.752 size:60%
of the mountain...

2135
01:49:45.351 --> 01:49:47.052 size:60%
my stomach got so bloated...

2136
01:49:47.652 --> 01:49:49.885 size:60%
I was sure I was going
to shit my pants, man!

2137
01:49:50.119 --> 01:49:51.518 size:60%
I took five steps...

2138
01:49:51.819 --> 01:49:53.418 size:60%
and then rested for ten seconds.

2139
01:49:53.618 --> 01:49:56.752 size:60%
Then I took five steps,
and I almost shit myself.

2140
01:49:57.418 --> 01:49:57.885 size:60%
Dude...

2141
01:49:58.052 --> 01:50:00.685 size:60%
So, you managed not to shit
even though you had diarrhea?

2142
01:50:01.418 --> 01:50:03.318 size:60%
I got here,
and the guy served me a tea...

2143
01:50:03.418 --> 01:50:04.318 size:60%
I drink the tea.

2144
01:50:04.485 --> 01:50:06.119 size:60%
I finish the tea, man,
and leave the tent...

2145
01:50:06.685 --> 01:50:09.552 size:60%
Man, I said to him:
“Emergency!

2146
01:50:09.618 --> 01:50:11.485 size:60%
I need a toilet!
I need a toilet!”

2147
01:50:13.052 --> 01:50:14.685 size:60%
Quick, it’s a toilet emergency!

2148
01:50:14.752 --> 01:50:18.618 size:60%
Man, so they point out the little
tent they set up for the toilet.

2149
01:50:18.752 --> 01:50:19.119 size:60%
That’s the toilet?

2150
01:50:19.351 --> 01:50:20.052 size:60%
That’s just for pee, right?

2151
01:50:20.418 --> 01:50:20.952 size:60%
Man...

2152
01:50:21.418 --> 01:50:22.451 size:60%
I went in there, dude.

2153
01:50:22.785 --> 01:50:25.085 size:60%
So, I’m squatting, and my
pants are around my knees, dude.

2154
01:50:25.119 --> 01:50:27.852 size:60%
You know, I’m, I’m like this...

2155
01:50:27.919 --> 01:50:30.351 size:60%
and it’s not enough, I’m not
close enough to the toilet, man!

2156
01:50:30.685 --> 01:50:33.585 size:60%
So, he pooped on the rock!
He actually pooped on the rock!

2157
01:50:33.652 --> 01:50:34.919 size:60%
It was really coming out, man.

2158
01:50:35.518 --> 01:50:37.485 size:60%
-Did you shit on yourself?
-It was a bomb, man.

2159
01:50:38.718 --> 01:50:39.952 size:60%
The tent...

2160
01:50:42.652 --> 01:50:44.052 size:60%
It was covered in shit!

2161
01:50:46.119 --> 01:50:48.518 size:60%
Man, I ruined that tent.

2162
01:50:49.385 --> 01:50:50.752 size:60%
The tent was... The guys...

2163
01:50:50.819 --> 01:50:51.418 size:60%
they...

2164
01:50:51.485 --> 01:50:52.718 size:60%
they just finished setting it up!

2165
01:50:52.985 --> 01:50:54.019 size:60%
And I get to the base camp...

2166
01:50:54.385 --> 01:50:56.952 size:60%
They just finished setting it up!
They put the ropes...

2167
01:50:57.451 --> 01:50:58.952 size:60%
And I ruined that tent.

2168
01:51:00.351 --> 01:51:01.718 size:60%
5 minutes after it was set up.
Oh, that’s good!

2169
01:51:01.819 --> 01:51:02.485 size:60%
Man...

2170
01:51:02.552 --> 01:51:03.618 size:60%
so after that...

2171
01:51:03.685 --> 01:51:05.451 size:60%
what could I do?

2172
01:51:05.685 --> 01:51:07.485 size:60%
I was in there for an hour, man.

2173
01:51:07.552 --> 01:51:08.852 size:60%
I had to clean everything up.

2174
01:51:08.952 --> 01:51:09.952 size:60%
No, that story is too crazy.

2175
01:51:10.052 --> 01:51:11.819 size:60%
I can imagine him in there
cleaning up his shit.

2176
01:51:11.885 --> 01:51:13.919 size:60%
Man, he set off a bomb!
A bomb in the toilet, my god.

2177
01:51:13.985 --> 01:51:15.618 size:60%
Man, this guy is too much...

2178
01:51:15.785 --> 01:51:16.618 size:60%
He’s too much.

2179
01:51:20.585 --> 01:51:22.752 size:60%
That’s it, the wind has
died down, so we can go.

2180
01:51:23.985 --> 01:51:24.985 size:60%
That’s the oxygen tank.

2181
01:51:25.052 --> 01:51:26.819 size:60%
We’re not gonna use it now,
but we will later.

2182
01:51:27.451 --> 01:51:28.819 size:60%
The tank is all set. Ready?

2183
01:51:29.652 --> 01:51:31.652 size:60%
We’ll be covering 700 meters of
elevation

2184
01:51:31.952 --> 01:51:32.952 size:60%
to get to get to Camp 3.

2185
01:51:33.652 --> 01:51:35.052 size:60%
Camp 3, tomorrow morning.

2186
01:51:35.085 --> 01:51:36.718 size:60%
Camp 4, tomorrow evening.

2187
01:51:37.485 --> 01:51:38.119 size:60%
Then the summit!

2188
01:51:38.351 --> 01:51:40.385 size:60%
Tomorrow evening,
we’re doing the summit, man!

2189
01:51:40.885 --> 01:51:41.518 size:60%
Summit time, bro.

2190
01:51:41.685 --> 01:51:44.552 size:60%
Man!
I can’t even believe it, huh?

2191
01:51:44.885 --> 01:51:45.852 size:60%
It’s tomorrow!

2192
01:51:46.019 --> 01:51:49.119 size:60%
-The summit! Tomorrow night!
-The summit! Summit!

2193
01:51:49.819 --> 01:51:51.119 size:60%
Now I’m thinking I can do Camp 3.

2194
01:51:51.451 --> 01:51:52.785 size:60%
After that, who knows!a

2195
01:51:52.852 --> 01:51:53.785 size:60%
But we’ll find out!

2196
01:51:54.652 --> 01:51:56.518 size:60%
In any case,
we won’t be breaking at Camp 3!

2197
01:51:56.718 --> 01:51:58.385 size:60%
If you’re not okay at Camp 3,
man...

2198
01:51:58.785 --> 01:52:01.085 size:60%
it’s too bad. Once you get to
Camp 3, there’s no turning back.

2199
01:52:02.585 --> 01:52:03.618 size:60%
It’s not gonna be easy...

2200
01:52:03.685 --> 01:52:04.652 size:60%
but that’s why I’m here.

2201
01:52:05.485 --> 01:52:06.718 size:60%
That’s exactly why I’m here.

2202
01:52:08.418 --> 01:52:10.685 size:60%
-It’s our turn to play now.
-No more excuses.

2203
01:52:11.618 --> 01:52:12.652 size:60%
We’re not slowing down anymore.

2204
01:52:12.718 --> 01:52:13.852 size:60%
This is the final stretch.

2205
01:52:14.718 --> 01:52:15.819 size:60%
I got butterflies in my stomach.

2206
01:52:17.451 --> 01:52:18.685 size:60%
There’s
some serious wind up there!

2207
01:52:20.585 --> 01:52:21.385 size:60%
Here we go!

2208
01:52:22.518 --> 01:52:23.685 size:60%
We’re climbing Everest.

2209
01:52:33.785 --> 01:52:34.852 size:60%
This is just the beginning!

2210
01:52:36.919 --> 01:52:38.351 size:60%
And... it’s already hard.

2211
01:53:02.852 --> 01:53:03.819 size:60%
Go slowly...

2212
01:53:05.119 --> 01:53:06.485 size:60%
and we’ll make the summit.

2213
01:53:06.752 --> 01:53:08.819 size:60%
If we run like a rabbit,
then no summit.

2214
01:53:08.952 --> 01:53:11.119 size:60%
-No summit. Be a turtle.
-Yeah.

2215
01:53:13.985 --> 01:53:15.919 size:60%
I’m trying not
to think about the difficulty.

2216
01:53:18.418 --> 01:53:20.351 size:60%
Each step
brings me closer to the goal.

2217
01:53:27.485 --> 01:53:28.119 size:60%
An avalanche!

2218
01:53:39.785 --> 01:53:41.652 size:60%
It’s okay on our side,
we’re safe.

2219
01:53:55.718 --> 01:53:57.552 size:60%
There’s a
traffic jam to get to Camp 3.

2220
01:53:58.318 --> 01:54:00.119 size:60%
We’re going to put on the
oxygen so we can speed up.

2221
01:54:00.351 --> 01:54:01.351 size:60%
We have to hurry,

2222
01:54:01.418 --> 01:54:02.919 size:60%
because in the afternoon,
the weather will be bad.

2223
01:54:06.585 --> 01:54:07.952 size:60%
Okay! Oxygen on!

2224
01:54:08.652 --> 01:54:09.718 size:60%
Now I feel it, man.

2225
01:54:10.119 --> 01:54:11.418 size:60%
Well, from now on...

2226
01:54:11.985 --> 01:54:13.819 size:60%
I’ll be wearing
my oxygen...

2227
01:54:14.819 --> 01:54:15.985 size:60%
for the 48 hours.

2228
01:54:26.919 --> 01:54:28.385 size:60%
Holy shit!

2229
01:54:30.119 --> 01:54:31.685 size:60%
This stuff is so crazy!

2230
01:54:38.985 --> 01:54:40.852 size:60%
Don’t get too close,
it’s really deep.

2231
01:54:44.985 --> 01:54:46.952 size:60%
Take a real big jump.

2232
01:55:40.952 --> 01:55:42.119 size:60%
Camp 3!

2233
01:55:45.885 --> 01:55:47.685 size:60%
The good news is,
that we’re at Camp 3.

2234
01:55:47.852 --> 01:55:49.785 size:60%
The bad news is,
that we’re only at 7000 meters.

2235
01:55:49.985 --> 01:55:50.885 size:60%
Goddamn.

2236
01:55:50.952 --> 01:55:53.119 size:60%
We can officially say that
this is our highest altitude.

2237
01:55:53.451 --> 01:55:54.819 size:60%
We passed the 7000-mark, bro.

2238
01:55:55.019 --> 01:55:56.085 size:60%
We’re at 7000!

2239
01:55:56.385 --> 01:55:59.785 size:60%
Our next step is 8000...
and after that, is the summit.

2240
01:56:01.985 --> 01:56:03.318 size:60%
I don’t even know how I got here.

2241
01:56:03.919 --> 01:56:04.752 size:60%
I...

2242
01:56:05.518 --> 01:56:06.451 size:60%
I don’t know.

2243
01:56:08.518 --> 01:56:10.085 size:60%
Last night, there were
clouds at the summit...

2244
01:56:10.351 --> 01:56:12.351 size:60%
and there was a lot
of wind at Camp 4.

2245
01:56:14.752 --> 01:56:17.451 size:60%
A lot of people turned back,
so we hope that tomorrow...

2246
01:56:17.752 --> 01:56:18.718 size:60%
that won’t be our case.

2247
01:56:19.351 --> 01:56:20.518 size:60%
The problem is that now,

2248
01:56:20.585 --> 01:56:21.819 size:60%
more people will be
climbing tomorrow...

2249
01:56:22.385 --> 01:56:24.785 size:60%
because so many people turned
back today and will try again.

2250
01:56:25.019 --> 01:56:26.119 size:60%
So, I guess...

2251
01:56:27.019 --> 01:56:28.119 size:60%
we’ll see what happens.

2252
01:56:29.652 --> 01:56:30.418 size:60%
Are you good?

2253
01:56:33.752 --> 01:56:34.652 size:60%
How are you, man?

2254
01:56:35.618 --> 01:56:37.819 size:60%
-I’m tired.
-But we’re here!

2255
01:56:37.952 --> 01:56:39.552 size:60%
Holy shit, we are, bro!

2256
01:56:40.485 --> 01:56:41.885 size:60%
We’ve been wearing oxygen and
waiting...

2257
01:56:42.618 --> 01:56:43.518 size:60%
and now, we’re here.

2258
01:56:44.518 --> 01:56:45.552 size:60%
This entire year...

2259
01:56:46.985 --> 01:56:48.852 size:60%
has been
in anticipation of two days...

2260
01:56:49.852 --> 01:56:51.585 size:60%
Tomorrow and the day after
tomorrow.

2261
01:56:53.785 --> 01:56:55.085 size:60%
Now, I’m getting scared.

2262
01:57:03.718 --> 01:57:04.952 size:60%
We’re waking up at camp 3.

2263
01:57:05.119 --> 01:57:06.585 size:60%
It’s the big wakeup call!

2264
01:57:07.119 --> 01:57:08.718 size:60%
It’s pretty windy right now.

2265
01:57:10.485 --> 01:57:12.119 size:60%
It’s gonna
be a long walk to Camp 4.

2266
01:57:12.852 --> 01:57:14.752 size:60%
We can rest a little
bit once we’re there,

2267
01:57:14.819 --> 01:57:15.852 size:60%
and then head to the summit.

2268
01:57:18.752 --> 01:57:19.752 size:60%
What’s going on?

2269
01:57:19.952 --> 01:57:21.585 size:60%
2 oxygen tanks have disappeared.

2270
01:57:21.752 --> 01:57:24.685 size:60%
Wait, where are the tanks? They
stole them from us? At Camp 3?

2271
01:57:24.885 --> 01:57:26.652 size:60%
Yeah, yes, during the night.

2272
01:57:26.919 --> 01:57:28.518 size:60%
We had 2 oxygen tanks stolen!

2273
01:57:28.585 --> 01:57:29.852 size:60%
They stole two of our tanks?!

2274
01:57:30.019 --> 01:57:30.919 size:60%
Yeah, two tanks.

2275
01:57:31.919 --> 01:57:33.752 size:60%
Some people really are bastards,
bro!

2276
01:57:34.518 --> 01:57:36.652 size:60%
It must have been the
people who turned back yesterday.

2277
01:57:36.885 --> 01:57:38.351 size:60%
They want to try
the summit again...

2278
01:57:38.418 --> 01:57:39.785 size:60%
except they didn’t have enough
tanks.

2279
01:57:40.385 --> 01:57:41.852 size:60%
And so, they stole ours.

2280
01:57:45.385 --> 01:57:47.283 size:60%
That’s so crazy! An oxygen
tank

2281
01:57:47.353 --> 01:57:48.498 size:60%
is your safety net up there.

2282
01:57:49.418 --> 01:57:51.163 size:60%
You can’t steal
oxygen from others!

2283
01:57:52.018 --> 01:57:53.883 size:60%
At this altitude,
you need it to survive!

2284
01:57:54.590 --> 01:57:57.898 size:60%
A human being shouldn’t do that
to another! It’s totally immoral.

2285
01:57:58.650 --> 01:58:00.803 size:60%
Well, fortunately,
we have some emergency tanks.

2286
01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:02.323 size:60%
But the thing is that...

2287
01:58:03.018 --> 01:58:05.258 size:60%
we have to hope all goes well,
because now we have no backups.

2288
01:58:05.585 --> 01:58:07.218 size:60%
All right,
let’s hope all goes well.

2289
01:58:24.048 --> 01:58:25.138 size:60%
What just happened, Mathis?

2290
01:58:25.585 --> 01:58:27.298 size:60%
The guy
in front of me just fell down!

2291
01:58:37.652 --> 01:58:38.618 size:60%
Can you stand up?

2292
01:58:42.618 --> 01:58:44.018 size:60%
Come on, bro! Stand up!

2293
01:58:44.752 --> 01:58:45.818 size:60%
Come on, stand up!

2294
01:58:52.938 --> 01:58:54.338 size:60%
Thank you, bro.

2295
01:59:03.318 --> 01:59:04.203 size:60%
You’re out of oxygen.

2296
01:59:04.978 --> 01:59:05.938 size:60%
You’re out of oxygen!

2297
01:59:07.018 --> 01:59:08.618 size:60%
-No more oxygen?
-No.

2298
01:59:09.552 --> 01:59:11.058 size:60%
-My tank is empty?
-Yes.

2299
01:59:11.552 --> 01:59:13.058 size:60%
-Ah. Okay.
-You can see right here.

2300
01:59:18.685 --> 01:59:19.738 size:60%
Don’t you have a Sherpa?

2301
01:59:21.585 --> 01:59:22.738 size:60%
Where’s your Sherpa?

2302
01:59:29.418 --> 01:59:30.218 size:60%
What’s wrong with him?

2303
01:59:30.418 --> 01:59:31.538 size:60%
They found him up there,

2304
01:59:31.753 --> 01:59:32.923 size:60%
and the Sherpas are going

2305
01:59:32.993 --> 01:59:34.378 size:60%
to take him down to an
emergency helicopter.

2306
01:59:34.618 --> 01:59:36.643 size:60%
Dude,
what a horrible thing to witness.

2307
01:59:36.938 --> 01:59:39.358 size:60%
-It really hurts my heart.
-Yeah, but...

2308
01:59:39.418 --> 01:59:40.258 size:60%
I can’t look.

2309
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:43.002 size:60%
We’re
entering the death zone now.

2310
01:59:43.073 --> 01:59:45.098 size:60%
It’s the home stretch
for climbing Everest.

2311
01:59:50.967 --> 01:59:51.871 size:60%
I can do this.

2312
01:59:54.718 --> 01:59:57.123 size:60%
I’m doing this for all the people
who said it wasn’t possible.

2313
01:59:59.098 --> 02:00:00.178 size:60%
To show people...

2314
02:00:01.018 --> 02:00:01.963 size:60%
you have to believe in them.

2315
02:00:02.858 --> 02:00:03.658 size:60%
I’m gonna make it.

2316
02:00:06.885 --> 02:00:08.458 size:60%
Small step by small step...

2317
02:00:09.618 --> 02:00:10.403 size:60%
I’ll get there.

2318
02:00:10.898 --> 02:00:12.938 size:60%
Slowly but
surely, I’ll get to the top.

2319
02:00:14.885 --> 02:00:16.058 size:60%
I’m going to suffer!

2320
02:00:18.351 --> 02:00:19.538 size:60%
But we’re going to do it!

2321
02:00:23.819 --> 02:00:25.218 size:60%
I’m not gonna give up!

2322
02:00:32.318 --> 02:00:33.683 size:60%
Let’s go!

2323
02:00:34.797 --> 02:00:35.637 size:60%
Camp 4!

2324
02:00:45.858 --> 02:00:46.778 size:60%
We did it, man.

2325
02:00:47.485 --> 02:00:48.843 size:60%
We made it to Camp 4.

2326
02:00:49.704 --> 02:00:50.898 size:60%
You know
what’s in store for us now...

2327
02:00:53.585 --> 02:00:56.338 size:60%
Goddamn! I’m so happy man!

2328
02:00:59.585 --> 02:01:01.203 size:60%
Damn, we’re here, man!

2329
02:01:01.538 --> 02:01:03.218 size:60%
I’ve never been so
ready for anything!

2330
02:01:03.351 --> 02:01:04.718 size:60%
We’ll be up there
in about 10 hours. 10 hours!

2331
02:01:05.994 --> 02:01:09.178 size:60%
We’re gonna crush it, man!
We’re gonna crush it!

2332
02:01:13.885 --> 02:01:14.938 size:60%
Ila!

2333
02:01:16.411 --> 02:01:18.418 size:60%
-Ah! Congratulations, man!
-We did Ama Dablam...

2334
02:01:18.489 --> 02:01:19.498 size:60%
And now Everest!

2335
02:01:22.351 --> 02:01:25.203 size:60%
Manish! Hey, brother,
we’ve almost done it!

2336
02:01:25.273 --> 02:01:28.083 size:60%
My bro! This year,
you finally did it, bro!

2337
02:01:28.153 --> 02:01:30.752 size:60%
-This year, you finally did it!
-No, we did it! You and me...

2338
02:01:30.865 --> 02:01:31.858 size:60%
We did it!

2339
02:01:32.451 --> 02:01:33.363 size:60%
Manish doesn’t know yet,

2340
02:01:33.433 --> 02:01:35.458 size:60%
but if we make it to the top,
I have a gift for him.

2341
02:01:39.752 --> 02:01:40.643 size:60%
As you can see...

2342
02:01:41.658 --> 02:01:43.043 size:60%
there’s some debris from
the tents...

2343
02:01:44.018 --> 02:01:45.058 size:60%
It’s not very clean.

2344
02:01:45.819 --> 02:01:47.563 size:60%
There’s trash everywhere...

2345
02:01:47.957 --> 02:01:49.003 size:60%
absolutely everywhere!

2346
02:01:49.398 --> 02:01:51.523 size:60%
There’s food...
freeze dried food...

2347
02:01:52.175 --> 02:01:53.418 size:60%
and a lot of old tents.

2348
02:01:54.785 --> 02:01:56.483 size:60%
When it comes to littering...

2349
02:01:56.553 --> 02:01:58.698 size:60%
it’s so extreme up here, and...

2350
02:01:58.858 --> 02:02:00.883 size:60%
the weather changes so
quickly at high altitudes,

2351
02:02:00.953 --> 02:02:02.283 size:60%
that they can’t go back up.

2352
02:02:02.353 --> 02:02:04.603 size:60%
The tents that get caught by
the wind stay where they land.

2353
02:02:04.818 --> 02:02:07.218 size:60%
And it’s gonna create a mess,
but it’s not intentional.

2354
02:02:07.726 --> 02:02:09.563 size:60%
And then,
there are always the people

2355
02:02:09.633 --> 02:02:10.778 size:60%
who throw their
food on the ground.

2356
02:02:11.078 --> 02:02:11.723 size:60%
Yeah, it’s true!

2357
02:02:11.793 --> 02:02:13.483 size:60%
But it’ll start to get better
because there’s pressure

2358
02:02:13.553 --> 02:02:14.818 size:60%
to keep the mountain clean.

2359
02:02:16.424 --> 02:02:18.929 size:60%
Unfortunately, there was
another team who just left...

2360
02:02:19.826 --> 02:02:21.978 size:60%
and their tent was here
and look at what they left.

2361
02:02:22.552 --> 02:02:24.163 size:60%
They didn’t pick up any trash...

2362
02:02:24.778 --> 02:02:26.043 size:60%
or take anything down...

2363
02:02:26.445 --> 02:02:28.123 size:60%
so, it’s
going to stay on the mountain.

2364
02:02:29.498 --> 02:02:30.858 size:60%
It’s a real shame.

2365
02:02:31.618 --> 02:02:32.858 size:60%
It’s bad manners.

2366
02:02:33.885 --> 02:02:35.243 size:60%
Whether it’s at camp 4, or...

2367
02:02:36.298 --> 02:02:37.403 size:60%
or in Paris, uh...

2368
02:02:37.991 --> 02:02:39.098 size:60%
you throw away your trash...

2369
02:02:39.778 --> 02:02:40.858 size:60%
you don’t leave it on the ground.

2370
02:02:45.698 --> 02:02:47.178 size:60%
That’s the most beautiful
sunset I’ve ever seen.

2371
02:02:50.022 --> 02:02:51.178 size:60%
Goddamn...

2372
02:02:52.653 --> 02:02:53.843 size:60%
We’re so small, man.

2373
02:02:55.536 --> 02:02:56.978 size:60%
We’re so small in this world.

2374
02:03:02.018 --> 02:03:03.283 size:60%
The summit is over there.

2375
02:03:04.858 --> 02:03:06.283 size:60%
I’m gonna
make my dream come true.

2376
02:03:07.178 --> 02:03:08.163 size:60%
I’m this close...

2377
02:03:08.233 --> 02:03:09.323 size:60%
to making my dream come true.

2378
02:03:11.178 --> 02:03:12.843 size:60%
The feeling of
saying to yourself...

2379
02:03:13.513 --> 02:03:14.763 size:60%
that you might get there...

2380
02:03:15.758 --> 02:03:17.203 size:60%
that you’re two or three steps
away...

2381
02:03:17.958 --> 02:03:19.858 size:60%
that feeling is amazing.

2382
02:03:20.652 --> 02:03:21.963 size:60%
I thought I was going to be
exhausted

2383
02:03:22.039 --> 02:03:23.658 size:60%
when we got to Camp 4...

2384
02:03:24.938 --> 02:03:26.033 size:60%
That I’d be dead.

2385
02:03:26.104 --> 02:03:27.024 size:60%
We’re finally in good shape!

2386
02:03:27.752 --> 02:03:29.403 size:60%
I thought
I was going to feel like shit...

2387
02:03:30.610 --> 02:03:32.403 size:60%
but in the end I got here,
and...

2388
02:03:33.018 --> 02:03:34.163 size:60%
I feel okay, dude!

2389
02:03:35.326 --> 02:03:37.363 size:60%
And... there’s nothing more
satisfying...

2390
02:03:38.150 --> 02:03:39.318 size:60%
than feeling ready.

2391
02:03:40.618 --> 02:03:42.323 size:60%
But that’s the goal,
to be okay...

2392
02:03:42.696 --> 02:03:43.763 size:60%
and to be safe.

2393
02:03:43.833 --> 02:03:45.283 size:60%
To be clear about
what you’re doing...

2394
02:03:45.443 --> 02:03:46.883 size:60%
to be
clear about the situation...

2395
02:03:46.953 --> 02:03:48.403 size:60%
to understand what’s
going on around you...

2396
02:03:48.831 --> 02:03:50.043 size:60%
That’s what’s most important.

2397
02:03:50.858 --> 02:03:52.418 size:60%
Then you can make good decisions.

2398
02:03:53.819 --> 02:03:54.658 size:60%
Are you good?

2399
02:03:54.919 --> 02:03:56.963 size:60%
I’m so good. So, so good.

2400
02:03:57.033 --> 02:03:58.298 size:60%
-What do we need to leave?
-Me too.

2401
02:04:00.413 --> 02:04:01.618 size:60%
9 or 10, maybe.

2402
02:04:02.552 --> 02:04:04.178 size:60%
And how many
hours to the summit?

2403
02:04:05.752 --> 02:04:06.578 size:60%
9 or 10 hours?

2404
02:04:06.785 --> 02:04:08.018 size:60%
9 or 10 hours to
reach the summit?

2405
02:04:08.518 --> 02:04:11.958 size:60%
It will depend on the traffic,
though. There’s lots of people.

2406
02:04:12.414 --> 02:04:13.738 size:60%
-A lot of people, huh?
-Yeah.

2407
02:04:17.852 --> 02:04:19.643 size:60%
In 24 hours,
all this will be over.

2408
02:04:20.367 --> 02:04:21.683 size:60%
The project is coming to an end.

2409
02:04:23.298 --> 02:04:25.018 size:60%
It’s... kind of scary.

2410
02:04:28.518 --> 02:04:30.043 size:60%
Whatever happens, Mathis, uh...

2411
02:04:30.375 --> 02:04:31.298 size:60%
I want to thank you.

2412
02:04:41.385 --> 02:04:42.763 size:60%
So, now it’s 9pm.

2413
02:04:43.978 --> 02:04:45.123 size:60%
We have a long
night ahead of us.

2414
02:04:45.938 --> 02:04:47.563 size:60%
There’s no wind,
the conditions are perfect...

2415
02:04:48.210 --> 02:04:49.818 size:60%
but it’s so cold that it stings.

2416
02:04:50.658 --> 02:04:53.458 size:60%
Man! It’s time to go! Man!

2417
02:04:53.585 --> 02:04:54.538 size:60%
Let’s do this.

2418
02:05:01.385 --> 02:05:03.298 size:60%
-Let’s go, Manish.
-Yep.

2419
02:05:19.552 --> 02:05:20.403 size:60%
Here we go!

2420
02:05:21.337 --> 02:05:22.283 size:60%
To the summit!

2421
02:05:23.203 --> 02:05:26.258 size:60%
The final ascent!
With the whole team.

2422
02:05:27.685 --> 02:05:29.083 size:60%
We’re gonna do it guys.

2423
02:05:30.377 --> 02:05:31.958 size:60%
I’ll give it my all,
I won’t give up!

2424
02:06:30.418 --> 02:06:31.458 size:60%
It’s Ama Dablam!

2425
02:06:33.785 --> 02:06:34.858 size:60%
Crazy, huh?

2426
02:07:11.451 --> 02:07:12.458 size:60%
This is scary.

2427
02:07:13.685 --> 02:07:15.163 size:60%
There’s a lot of emptiness.

2428
02:07:15.233 --> 02:07:16.643 size:60%
I didn’t think it
would be like that.

2429
02:07:16.713 --> 02:07:18.083 size:60%
Everything is so steep.

2430
02:07:18.778 --> 02:07:21.098 size:60%
I confess... I’m scared.

2431
02:07:25.791 --> 02:07:26.923 size:60%
Goddamn...

2432
02:07:29.298 --> 02:07:32.458 size:60%
Ugh, I hate this. I hate it.

2433
02:07:44.217 --> 02:07:45.317 size:60%
A dead climber.

2434
02:07:45.851 --> 02:07:48.738 size:60%
Wait, where? Whoa, holy shit!

2435
02:07:51.604 --> 02:07:52.938 size:60%
How many years has he been here?

2436
02:07:53.009 --> 02:07:54.338 size:60%
-3 years old.
-3 years?

2437
02:07:54.431 --> 02:07:55.198 size:60%
Yeah.

2438
02:07:56.764 --> 02:07:58.178 size:60%
Oh no, that’s crazy.

2439
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:03.818 size:60%
Oh, my god...

2440
02:08:08.837 --> 02:08:10.658 size:60%
I’m scared Mathis.
I’m scared now.

2441
02:08:10.729 --> 02:08:11.798 size:60%
No, it’s okay, it’s okay...

2442
02:08:11.869 --> 02:08:13.098 size:60%
I’m scared, dammit!

2443
02:08:14.231 --> 02:08:15.238 size:60%
There are too many people.

2444
02:09:03.298 --> 02:09:03.963 size:60%
Come on!

2445
02:09:04.378 --> 02:09:05.363 size:60%
Just a little bit further!

2446
02:09:08.178 --> 02:09:09.123 size:60%
We’re almost there.

2447
02:09:09.738 --> 02:09:10.738 size:60%
We’re almost there!

2448
02:09:34.497 --> 02:09:35.323 size:60%
Just breathe...

2449
02:09:36.578 --> 02:09:37.523 size:60%
and listen...

2450
02:09:38.858 --> 02:09:39.683 size:60%
and observe...

2451
02:09:41.218 --> 02:09:43.578 size:60%
and before you
know it, you’ll be at the top.

2452
02:10:14.851 --> 02:10:16.003 size:60%
I fucking did it!

2453
02:10:24.384 --> 02:10:25.938 size:60%
I fucking did it.

2454
02:10:31.851 --> 02:10:32.883 size:60%
We did it, bro!

2455
02:10:34.978 --> 02:10:35.898 size:60%
We did it!

2456
02:10:36.557 --> 02:10:37.643 size:60%
Come on, we did it!

2457
02:10:37.713 --> 02:10:39.123 size:60%
You did it! You did it, man.

2458
02:10:41.637 --> 02:10:42.477 size:60%
You did it.

2459
02:10:48.978 --> 02:10:51.158 size:60%
Thank you, Manish! We did it.

2460
02:10:51.964 --> 02:10:53.658 size:60%
We did it, man!

2461
02:10:56.098 --> 02:10:57.138 size:60%
We fucking did it.

2462
02:10:58.077 --> 02:10:59.283 size:60%
-You did it. You did it, bro.
-Thank you, Mathis.

2463
02:10:59.353 --> 02:11:01.418 size:60%
Thanks, it’s all thanks to you!

2464
02:11:01.553 --> 02:11:03.123 size:60%
And it’s all thanks to you guys!

2465
02:11:03.541 --> 02:11:04.563 size:60%
Without the Sherpas...

2466
02:11:04.818 --> 02:11:05.858 size:60%
we would never be here!

2467
02:11:06.073 --> 02:11:07.298 size:60%
We never would have made it!

2468
02:11:09.552 --> 02:11:11.483 size:60%
And thanks
to everyone who believed in me...

2469
02:11:12.858 --> 02:11:14.218 size:60%
Mathis, we did it bro!

2470
02:11:14.385 --> 02:11:15.285 size:60%
Dude, we did it... Come on!

2471
02:11:24.151 --> 02:11:26.136 size:60%
I always wondered
what it meant to be the best...

2472
02:11:27.458 --> 02:11:30.043 size:60%
It’s being around you guys,
who are all stronger than me.

2473
02:11:30.858 --> 02:11:32.363 size:60%
I know I’m not alone!

2474
02:11:32.978 --> 02:11:34.443 size:60%
The Sherpas all helped me.

2475
02:11:35.385 --> 02:11:36.243 size:60%
In the end...

2476
02:11:38.258 --> 02:11:39.363 size:60%
I did it with oxygen,

2477
02:11:39.433 --> 02:11:40.978 size:60%
but there are
those who do it without oxygen!

2478
02:11:41.691 --> 02:11:42.643 size:60%
They’re the real bosses!

2479
02:11:43.818 --> 02:11:45.203 size:60%
They’re the ones who
should be congratulated!

2480
02:11:46.738 --> 02:11:48.083 size:60%
We
shouldn’t try to be the best...

2481
02:11:48.354 --> 02:11:50.123 size:60%
we should just try to be...

2482
02:11:51.458 --> 02:11:54.178 size:60%
we should try to be better than,
than yesterday.

2483
02:11:55.132 --> 02:11:56.563 size:60%
We should all do projects...

2484
02:11:59.211 --> 02:12:00.276 size:60%
We have to stop...

2485
02:12:00.538 --> 02:12:01.843 size:60%
being behind screens, and...

2486
02:12:03.658 --> 02:12:06.003 size:60%
and scrolling,
and living vicariously.

2487
02:12:07.978 --> 02:12:08.923 size:60%
Get outside!

2488
02:12:09.978 --> 02:12:11.603 size:60%
If you have a project, do it...

2489
02:12:11.976 --> 02:12:13.043 size:60%
and don’t listen to people...

2490
02:12:13.311 --> 02:12:15.883 size:60%
because if I had listened to
people, I wouldn’t be here,

2491
02:12:16.464 --> 02:12:17.317 size:60%
dammit!

2492
02:12:18.178 --> 02:12:19.778 size:60%
I wouldn’t be here!
So, don’t listen to people, okay!

2493
02:12:21.352 --> 02:12:22.683 size:60%
If you want to do something...

2494
02:12:23.418 --> 02:12:25.643 size:60%
then do it!
It doesn’t matter if you fail!

2495
02:12:26.178 --> 02:12:29.483 size:60%
You still learned something!
Life is made for learning!

2496
02:12:31.064 --> 02:12:32.249 size:60%
That’s how we live!

2497
02:12:32.858 --> 02:12:34.418 size:60%
That’s how we...

2498
02:12:36.133 --> 02:12:38.978 size:60%
Dude... this year dude I
learned about life, bro, I swear.

2499
02:12:40.578 --> 02:12:41.858 size:60%
I feel so alive!

2500
02:12:44.318 --> 02:12:45.618 size:60%
Without you,
I wouldn’t be here, man!

2501
02:12:46.199 --> 02:12:48.418 size:60%
You know that... without you,
I wouldn’t be here either.

2502
02:12:49.211 --> 02:12:51.104 size:60%
In life, nothing is done alone...

2503
02:12:51.175 --> 02:12:51.698 size:60%
No.

2504
02:12:51.841 --> 02:12:53.378 size:60%
it’s better
to do it with friends.

2505
02:12:55.804 --> 02:12:56.758 size:60%
Thanks to all my friends...

2506
02:12:57.238 --> 02:12:58.283 size:60%
who have always been there...

2507
02:12:58.353 --> 02:13:00.523 size:60%
And thanks
to Idriss who trained me.

2508
02:13:00.938 --> 02:13:02.203 size:60%
Thanks to all my partners...

2509
02:13:02.658 --> 02:13:04.403 size:60%
who are out there...
who believed in me!

2510
02:13:04.473 --> 02:13:05.883 size:60%
And thanks to all
my subscribers...

2511
02:13:06.418 --> 02:13:09.098 size:60%
who have always supported me, no
matter what, on all my projects.

2512
02:13:09.598 --> 02:13:11.323 size:60%
This is our summit,
I’m not alone, you guys.

2513
02:13:12.058 --> 02:13:13.018 size:60%
We did this together.

2514
02:13:18.711 --> 02:13:20.678 size:60%
Unwrap the ribbon,
there’s a surprise inside.

2515
02:13:26.944 --> 02:13:28.363 size:60%
“You are an inspiring man...

2516
02:13:28.658 --> 02:13:29.858 size:60%
I gave you life...

2517
02:13:30.198 --> 02:13:33.658 size:60%
and you gave that life meaning
with your first inspiration.

2518
02:13:35.656 --> 02:13:36.538 size:60%
Your mom.”

2519
02:13:45.498 --> 02:13:46.243 size:60%
Dude, you know...

2520
02:13:47.018 --> 02:13:49.603 size:60%
I never tell
my parents that I love them,

2521
02:13:50.218 --> 02:13:52.883 size:60%
but damn, I swear,
that when I was editing,

2522
02:13:53.258 --> 02:13:55.418 size:60%
I was so scared, bro! I
fucking love my parents so much!

2523
02:14:10.765 --> 02:14:14.138 size:60%
You killed it dude! You did good.
You did really good.

2524
02:14:16.117 --> 02:14:18.618 size:60%
Thank you, Ila Nuru...
Thank you, Manish.

2525
02:14:19.702 --> 02:14:20.363 size:60%
Hey, look...

2526
02:14:20.847 --> 02:14:21.983 size:60%
this is for Manish!

2527
02:14:22.261 --> 02:14:24.418 size:60%
Manish, congratulations my bro!

2528
02:14:27.218 --> 02:14:28.683 size:60%
You did it, bro!

2529
02:14:29.416 --> 02:14:30.698 size:60%
We did it, bro!

2530
02:14:31.457 --> 02:14:32.323 size:60%
My bro!

2531
02:14:33.022 --> 02:14:34.683 size:60%
Congratulations my, bro!

2532
02:14:35.698 --> 02:14:37.618 size:60%
Together we did it, my friend.

2533
02:14:38.458 --> 02:14:39.243 size:60%
And now...

2534
02:14:39.724 --> 02:14:40.869 size:60%
we’re going back.

2535
02:14:41.938 --> 02:14:43.043 size:60%
It’s not finished...

2536
02:14:43.282 --> 02:14:44.738 size:60%
we need to go back, okay?

2537
02:14:45.897 --> 02:14:46.337 size:60%
Yes.

2538
02:14:54.884 --> 02:14:55.858 size:60%
Good job, bro.

2539
02:15:14.604 --> 02:15:16.123 size:60%
It was both extraordinary...

2540
02:15:16.978 --> 02:15:18.498 size:60%
and at the same time, terrifying!

2541
02:15:21.404 --> 02:15:22.283 size:60%
And when I was there,

2542
02:15:22.353 --> 02:15:24.378 size:60%
I thought,
“Damn, I’m here risking my life.”

2543
02:15:26.411 --> 02:15:28.403 size:60%
It was overwhelming,
you’re up so high...

2544
02:15:28.473 --> 02:15:29.978 size:60%
and you’re dependent on oxygen.

2545
02:15:32.744 --> 02:15:33.604 size:60%
I’m so scared Mathis.

2546
02:15:33.731 --> 02:15:35.658 size:60%
Being that high
up is terrifying!

2547
02:15:47.285 --> 02:15:48.323 size:60%
Go fast, go fast!

2548
02:15:48.658 --> 02:15:51.578 size:60%
Everyone move! Fast, fast, fast!

2549
02:15:52.818 --> 02:15:54.043 size:60%
We’re
coming down from the summit...

2550
02:15:57.211 --> 02:15:58.283 size:60%
we’re following the ridge...

2551
02:16:02.444 --> 02:16:03.698 size:60%
and in the
distance we hear screams.

2552
02:16:04.014 --> 02:16:06.898 size:60%
Hurry, hurry! Go fast!
Go fast! Fast, fast, fast!

2553
02:16:07.418 --> 02:16:09.978 size:60%
The ledge we were on 40
minutes earlier collapsed.

2554
02:16:18.784 --> 02:16:19.923 size:60%
6 climbers fell at once.

2555
02:16:20.978 --> 02:16:22.323 size:60%
Four of them managed

2556
02:16:22.393 --> 02:16:23.963 size:60%
to hang on and the
other two went down the mountain.

2557
02:16:25.058 --> 02:16:26.123 size:60%
They tumbled down the slope...

2558
02:16:27.818 --> 02:16:28.538 size:60%
for 3000 meters.

2559
02:16:30.052 --> 02:16:31.178 size:60%
They died down there.

2560
02:16:36.364 --> 02:16:38.003 size:60%
But at the time,
I didn’t know that.

2561
02:16:38.698 --> 02:16:40.443 size:60%
I didn’t see them,
I just heard the screams.

2562
02:16:42.058 --> 02:16:43.243 size:60%
You’re up
there with an oxygen mask,

2563
02:16:43.313 --> 02:16:45.298 size:60%
you can’t talk, you don’t
understand what’s going on...

2564
02:16:48.618 --> 02:16:51.403 size:60%
And I realized that it’s not just
the mountain that’s dangerous.

2565
02:16:52.018 --> 02:16:53.443 size:60%
It’s the human beings.

2566
02:16:54.138 --> 02:16:55.603 size:60%
When there’s
a place that’s technical...

2567
02:16:55.931 --> 02:16:57.443 size:60%
and
someone isn’t trained enough...

2568
02:16:57.515 --> 02:16:58.858 size:60%
it’s going
to create traffic jams...

2569
02:16:59.446 --> 02:17:00.486 size:60%
and that’s dangerous.

2570
02:17:02.257 --> 02:17:03.211 size:60%
And that’s what happened.

2571
02:17:08.037 --> 02:17:09.603 size:60%
We just found a guy who’s...

2572
02:17:09.673 --> 02:17:11.163 size:60%
on the verge of life and death.

2573
02:17:12.258 --> 02:17:14.498 size:60%
So, Inès gave him the
rest of the oxygen that...

2574
02:17:15.117 --> 02:17:15.683 size:60%
he had.

2575
02:17:16.277 --> 02:17:17.916 size:60%
He changed out the tank.

2576
02:17:17.987 --> 02:17:20.323 size:60%
And so, I went without oxygen...

2577
02:17:20.946 --> 02:17:22.338 size:60%
-on our trip back down.
-Goodbye, then.

2578
02:17:24.118 --> 02:17:25.203 size:60%
Well, now, it’s my turn...

2579
02:17:25.397 --> 02:17:26.363 size:60%
for being tired.

2580
02:17:27.498 --> 02:17:30.018 size:60%
-I don’t know if...
-Are you going to be okay?

2581
02:17:32.565 --> 02:17:34.563 size:60%
Well, I gave my tank to that guy,
but...

2582
02:17:35.138 --> 02:17:36.738 size:60%
wow, I can already
feel the difference.

2583
02:17:37.324 --> 02:17:39.618 size:60%
It’s been 24
hours since we stopped walking.

2584
02:17:58.418 --> 02:17:59.498 size:60%
Thank you so much.

2585
02:18:02.423 --> 02:18:03.083 size:60%
It was hard.

2586
02:18:03.338 --> 02:18:05.123 size:60%
It was hard mentally,
it was hard physically...

2587
02:18:06.138 --> 02:18:07.879 size:60%
but I’m so glad
we did it together.

2588
02:18:08.138 --> 02:18:12.138 size:60%
Um, now back to reality...
There’s a very good energy.

2589
02:18:16.951 --> 02:18:18.443 size:60%
My son will see my video...

2590
02:18:19.271 --> 02:18:21.749 size:60%
My son will see
that his father climbed Everest

2591
02:18:21.833 --> 02:18:22.778 size:60%
when he was 22 years old.

2592
02:18:23.218 --> 02:18:24.298 size:60%
Everest at 22...

2593
02:18:24.369 --> 02:18:26.763 size:60%
My son! Don’t compare yourself...

2594
02:18:28.018 --> 02:18:29.334 size:60%
Do what you like, that’s what’s

2595
02:18:29.405 --> 02:18:30.963 size:60%
important,
if you ever watch this.

2596
02:18:31.898 --> 02:18:34.003 size:60%
It doesn’t matter,
if you want to be a cartoonist...

2597
02:18:34.498 --> 02:18:36.058 size:60%
just make
the project the best it can be.

2598
02:19:03.285 --> 02:19:04.058 size:60%
Is that my dad?

2599
02:19:08.118 --> 02:19:09.483 size:60%
I’m so proud of his success.

2600
02:19:10.658 --> 02:19:11.803 size:60%
When I was younger, I...

2601
02:19:12.471 --> 02:19:16.178 size:60%
I did what I wanted to do,
and now, it’s his turn, so...

2602
02:19:16.578 --> 02:19:18.243 size:60%
It’s true that it’s a little
weird for me because

2603
02:19:18.578 --> 02:19:20.923 size:60%
my generation and his
are completely different!

2604
02:19:21.198 --> 02:19:21.683 size:60%
And...

2605
02:19:21.753 --> 02:19:24.603 size:60%
I’m used to it now, but before
I was stubborn and would say,

2606
02:19:24.673 --> 02:19:27.843 size:60%
“No, I’m the one who’s right,
not you,” and... well,

2607
02:19:27.913 --> 02:19:29.178 size:60%
now I’ve changed
my mind a little bit.

2608
02:19:29.504 --> 02:19:31.723 size:60%
I’ve adapted. Yeah, I’ve adapted.

2609
02:19:31.793 --> 02:19:34.003 size:60%
I had to, because I’m not stupid,
you know?

2610
02:19:34.073 --> 02:19:35.363 size:60%
Because, well...

2611
02:19:35.616 --> 02:19:37.938 size:60%
there are times when you have
to listen to the young people,

2612
02:19:38.298 --> 02:19:39.098 size:60%
so I listen to him.

2613
02:19:45.347 --> 02:19:46.283 size:60%
After Everest...

2614
02:19:46.418 --> 02:19:49.338 size:60%
I didn’t want to make the same
mistake I made after Ama Dablam.

2615
02:19:51.159 --> 02:19:52.443 size:60%
I didn’t go back to Paris...

2616
02:19:54.098 --> 02:19:55.483 size:60%
I didn’t go back to the videos...

2617
02:19:56.698 --> 02:19:58.138 size:60%
I didn’t go back to my phone...

2618
02:20:00.510 --> 02:20:02.763 size:60%
I needed to take
a step back and disconnect...

2619
02:20:03.738 --> 02:20:05.378 size:60%
and savor
the end of this adventure.

2620
02:20:09.011 --> 02:20:10.163 size:60%
So, now I’m...

2621
02:20:10.744 --> 02:20:11.624 size:60%
isolated here.

2622
02:20:14.844 --> 02:20:16.203 size:60%
It’s crazy,
because you’ve just arrived...

2623
02:20:16.657 --> 02:20:17.922 size:60%
but I’ve
been here for three weeks.

2624
02:20:18.338 --> 02:20:19.963 size:60%
I go from farm to farm, and I...

2625
02:20:20.738 --> 02:20:21.578 size:60%
I work in the fields.

2626
02:20:22.570 --> 02:20:23.558 size:60%
Every day, right?

2627
02:20:23.629 --> 02:20:24.698 size:60%
Yeah, Every day, every day.

2628
02:20:25.144 --> 02:20:26.818 size:60%
Did you tell him about your
experience in Nepal or not?

2629
02:20:26.889 --> 02:20:27.298 size:60%
Yeah.

2630
02:20:27.417 --> 02:20:29.203 size:60%
That’s actually how I
came to work on his farm.

2631
02:20:29.273 --> 02:20:31.083 size:60%
I went to
visit his farm one day...

2632
02:20:31.154 --> 02:20:32.963 size:60%
and I introduced
myself and told my story.

2633
02:20:33.418 --> 02:20:35.018 size:60%
And he said, “No!
You really did that?

2634
02:20:35.233 --> 02:20:36.440 size:60%
You need to come
work on my farm!”

2635
02:20:36.724 --> 02:20:39.578 size:60%
And I said, okay, and after that,
we’ve been working together.

2636
02:20:41.118 --> 02:20:43.123 size:60%
I get up in the morning...
at 6am...

2637
02:20:43.618 --> 02:20:44.923 size:60%
and I go milk the cows.

2638
02:20:45.378 --> 02:20:47.203 size:60%
Then we cut the banana leaves...

2639
02:20:47.398 --> 02:20:48.523 size:60%
I plant rice...

2640
02:20:48.805 --> 02:20:50.845 size:60%
and in the
afternoon, I have my free time.

2641
02:20:53.404 --> 02:20:55.083 size:60%
So,
every rice shoot that I plant...

2642
02:20:55.153 --> 02:20:56.723 size:60%
will give one to two bunches...

2643
02:20:57.072 --> 02:20:57.963 size:60%
of rice grains.

2644
02:20:58.498 --> 02:21:00.603 size:60%
And everything we’ve
done since this morning...

2645
02:21:00.673 --> 02:21:01.603 size:60%
all those hours...

2646
02:21:02.059 --> 02:21:03.458 size:60%
will only yield
four bags of rice.

2647
02:21:04.364 --> 02:21:06.243 size:60%
Well,
he’s a very determined young man.

2648
02:21:06.578 --> 02:21:08.498 size:60%
And he works and
works without fear.

2649
02:21:13.064 --> 02:21:14.218 size:60%
Honestly, it’s incredible here.

2650
02:21:16.191 --> 02:21:17.083 size:60%
And the fact that...

2651
02:21:17.153 --> 02:21:18.763 size:60%
I don’t have a phone,
that I’m disconnected...

2652
02:21:19.738 --> 02:21:21.203 size:60%
and I can take time for myself...

2653
02:21:21.367 --> 02:21:24.163 size:60%
and discover how to do new
things I’ve never done before...

2654
02:21:24.611 --> 02:21:26.179 size:60%
like I did with the mountain.

2655
02:21:29.504 --> 02:21:30.763 size:60%
I really liked mountaineering...

2656
02:21:31.404 --> 02:21:32.509 size:60%
and I’ll continue to do it.

2657
02:21:33.578 --> 02:21:35.058 size:60%
There’s no doubt in my mind.

2658
02:21:36.038 --> 02:21:37.283 size:60%
I got closer to nature,

2659
02:21:37.353 --> 02:21:39.098 size:60%
I got closer to the
real moments in life.

2660
02:21:39.450 --> 02:21:40.523 size:60%
Things I was missing in life...

2661
02:21:41.298 --> 02:21:43.243 size:60%
because I was always in a rush,
and...

2662
02:21:43.658 --> 02:21:46.058 size:60%
there was the filming,
the videos, and the screens...

2663
02:21:47.244 --> 02:21:49.323 size:60%
And then I realized,
I’ve been here for three months.

2664
02:21:50.378 --> 02:21:52.483 size:60%
We’re all matrixed by our phones,
it’s crazy.

2665
02:21:53.476 --> 02:21:55.043 size:60%
But now,
I’m totally disconnected and...

2666
02:21:55.919 --> 02:21:57.898 size:60%
the phone is a poison!
It’s a drug!

2667
02:21:59.717 --> 02:22:00.218 size:60%
You know...

2668
02:22:00.698 --> 02:22:02.323 size:60%
of course you can
be on your phone,

2669
02:22:02.393 --> 02:22:04.043 size:60%
there’s so much cool
stuff on your phone...

2670
02:22:04.938 --> 02:22:07.203 size:60%
but too often,
we’re not doing anything,

2671
02:22:07.273 --> 02:22:08.883 size:60%
we’re scrolling in the void,
losing braincells!

2672
02:22:09.658 --> 02:22:12.098 size:60%
And I’m including myself! Because
I’m like that too, you know?

2673
02:22:14.105 --> 02:22:15.618 size:60%
Imagine if you
took all that time...

2674
02:22:16.211 --> 02:22:17.523 size:60%
and put down your cell phone...

2675
02:22:18.017 --> 02:22:18.843 size:60%
and then thought...

2676
02:22:19.578 --> 02:22:20.643 size:60%
“I’m going to do it too.

2677
02:22:21.037 --> 02:22:23.458 size:60%
I’m going to get moving,
I’m going to do things too.”

2678
02:22:25.031 --> 02:22:26.123 size:60%
When I
was at the base of Everest...

2679
02:22:26.379 --> 02:22:28.043 size:60%
I was looking at Everest,
and I thought...

2680
02:22:28.770 --> 02:22:31.058 size:60%
“I can’t do it.” It was so
high up, that I thought,

2681
02:22:31.225 --> 02:22:32.372 size:60%
“I can’t do it.”

2682
02:22:34.184 --> 02:22:35.043 size:60%
And I think there

2683
02:22:35.113 --> 02:22:36.483 size:60%
are a lot of people
out there who are like that too.

2684
02:22:36.778 --> 02:22:38.003 size:60%
I think there are a
lot of people who...

2685
02:22:38.481 --> 02:22:40.058 size:60%
have dreams that are so huge...

2686
02:22:40.395 --> 02:22:42.323 size:60%
that they say to themselves,
“It’s not possible,

2687
02:22:42.393 --> 02:22:43.058 size:60%
I can’t do it!”

2688
02:22:44.570 --> 02:22:45.723 size:60%
Even if you see a mountain

2689
02:22:45.793 --> 02:22:47.738 size:60%
that’s so high
it looks impossible to climb!

2690
02:22:48.418 --> 02:22:50.458 size:60%
If you go little by little,
you can climb it.

2691
02:22:51.338 --> 02:22:53.363 size:60%
Just take your time,
and you’ll climb it.

2692
02:22:53.764 --> 02:22:55.178 size:60%
And sometimes,

2693
02:22:55.778 --> 02:22:56.778 size:60%
it’ll be fucking hard!

2694
02:22:57.760 --> 02:22:58.642 size:60%
I really suffered!

2695
02:22:58.971 --> 02:22:59.843 size:60%
I mean...

2696
02:23:01.182 --> 02:23:02.363 size:60%
I’m not a mountaineer!

2697
02:23:04.424 --> 02:23:05.464 size:60%
I’d never done it before.

2698
02:23:05.594 --> 02:23:07.123 size:60%
But I got moving and thought,
“I’m going to go out and explore.

2699
02:23:08.018 --> 02:23:09.563 size:60%
I’m gonna climb Mount Everest!”

2700
02:23:10.034 --> 02:23:11.003 size:60%
Except when I said,

2701
02:23:11.073 --> 02:23:12.738 size:60%
“I’m going to climb Everest,” I
didn’t think that I could do it.

2702
02:23:14.318 --> 02:23:15.843 size:60%
And what I remember,
isn’t even Everest!

2703
02:23:16.365 --> 02:23:17.883 size:60%
It’s everything I discovered,
and...

2704
02:23:18.258 --> 02:23:19.963 size:60%
all the
mountains that I climbed...

2705
02:23:20.698 --> 02:23:22.203 size:60%
And all the adventures I went on,

2706
02:23:22.273 --> 02:23:23.403 size:60%
and all the people that I met.

2707
02:23:25.025 --> 02:23:26.898 size:60%
I opened myself up
to new possibilities.

2708
02:23:28.558 --> 02:23:29.963 size:60%
But that’s called, “Kaizen.”

2709
02:23:30.033 --> 02:23:31.283 size:60%
It’s the name of the documentary.

2710
02:23:31.353 --> 02:23:32.563 size:60%
That’s why I called it “Kaizen.”

2711
02:23:33.978 --> 02:23:35.283 size:60%
It means always improving...

2712
02:23:35.521 --> 02:23:36.523 size:60%
day after day...

2713
02:23:37.461 --> 02:23:39.179 size:60%
getting better little by little.

2714
02:23:40.457 --> 02:23:41.843 size:60%
Small step by small step...

2715
02:23:43.617 --> 02:23:44.818 size:60%
you climb the highest peaks.

2716
02:24:11.765 --> 02:24:12.883 size:60%
I can see the
question coming from

2717
02:24:12.953 --> 02:24:14.978 size:60%
kilometers away, “Inox,
what will you do after Everest?”

2718
02:24:15.778 --> 02:24:17.403 size:60%
I have plenty of
adventures to go on...

2719
02:24:17.473 --> 02:24:18.483 size:60%
plenty of things to do...

2720
02:24:18.553 --> 02:24:20.138 size:60%
and I don’t care
about doing bigger...

2721
02:24:20.209 --> 02:24:21.614 size:60%
or more impressive
things than Everest.

2722
02:24:23.465 --> 02:24:24.938 size:60%
I just want to try
something different.
